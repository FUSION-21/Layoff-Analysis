"📝🚀 Angular Interview Questions 🚀📝Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋 Are you looking to level up your Angular skills? Today, I wanted to share some helpful angular Interview questions that will enhance your understanding and productivity when working with Angular. Let's dive right in:1️⃣ TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Make sure you have a solid understanding of TypeScript concepts like classes, interfaces, and modules to leverage the full power of Angular.2️⃣ Components: Angular follows a component-based architecture. Each component encapsulates its own logic, HTML template, and styles. Remember to keep components small, focused, and reusable for easier maintenance and code organization.3️⃣ Data Binding: Angular provides powerful data binding capabilities. Use interpolation ({{ }}) for one-way data binding, and square brackets ([]) for property binding. Additionally, use parentheses (()) for event binding and two-way binding with the [(ngModel)] directive.4️⃣ Directives: Directives are a way to extend HTML with custom behavior. Angular provides built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngStyle. You can also create your own directives to manipulate the DOM or add custom functionality.5️⃣ Services: Services in Angular are singletons that provide shared functionality and data across components. Use services to handle business logic, API calls, and state management. Remember to inject services into components via dependency injection.6️⃣ Routing: Angular's powerful routing module allows you to build single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views. Configure routes using the RouterModule and navigate between views using the routerLink directive.7️⃣ Reactive Forms: When working with forms, Angular's reactive forms approach provides a robust solution. Use the FormBuilder and FormControl classes to create dynamic forms with validation and form state tracking.8️⃣ Lifecycle Hooks: Angular provides lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into component creation, rendering, and destruction. Explore hooks like ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, and ngOnDestroy to perform actions at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.9️⃣ Dependency Injection: Angular's dependency injection system is at the core of its architecture. Understand how to leverage it to provide and consume dependencies throughout your application.🔟 Testing: Angular has excellent support for testing. Use frameworks like Jasmine and tools like Karma or Jest to write unit tests for your components, services, and pipes. Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.If you found these notes helpful, don't forget to like and share. Feel free to connect with me Ashish Anand if you have any questions or want to discuss further.

"JUGGERNAUTThere’s a lot we can know about a word, just by going deep into the origin of the word, and how it was formed. For example, the word “tamarind” is derived from the Arabic word “Tamar-e-hind” meaning “dates from India”. Just by looking into the origin of this word, we can infer that it was an entity transferred from India to Arab region.Similarly, the word “Juggernaut” means “a huge, powerful, and overwhelming force”. More interesting is the origin of the word “Juggernaut”. It originates from the Sanskrit word Jaggannath, and was derived from the event of Jaggannath rath yatra, where the idols of Mahaprabhu is carried in an enormous carriage.ଜୟ ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ | জয় জগন্নাথ | Jai Jaggannath"

Not so much expressive, yet a guiding light in all our thoughts and actions. ✔️The purpose of this message is to highlight that both parents are equally important in the conditioning of their children. ✔️Stephen Kendrick outlines seven roles that a father plays in the life of his family: 1)Provider, 2)Protector, 3)Leader, 4)Teacher, 5) Helper, 6) Encourager, and friend.

Try it out (Desktop platform recommended)-https://lnkd.in/dcYMSX6vThis is an actual resume which is inside my portfolio site :) which may not be an ideal expectation of seeing a CV across industries. That's not the goal here. Rather this is an experiment to widen the scope of different comprehensive abilities in the creative field and enhance something very common and obvious in a unusual and experimental way. I just gave it a personal touch (which I think everyone tries to do so to position their identity.) However, PDFs ain't going anywhere :P Thought would be good to have in the profile. It has been made more like a creative experience rather than some other photo or videographic mediums which ain't as challenging to come up with. Just a single link and it's ready to interact with in real-time!Not too fancy and not too typical. Otherwise sudden change in the paradigm may overwhelm the viewer and the actual details which matter, will be lost.

"Presenting my Interactive Resume! Try it out (Desktop platform recommended)-https://lnkd.in/dcYMSX6vThis is an actual resume which is inside my portfolio site :) which may not be an ideal expectation of seeing a CV across industries. That's not the goal here. Rather this is an experiment to widen the scope of different comprehensive abilities in the creative field and enhance something very common and obvious in a unusual and experimental way. I just gave it a personal touch (which I think everyone tries to do so to position their identity.) However, PDFs ain't going anywhere :P Thought would be good to have in the profile. It has been made more like a creative experience rather than some other photo or videographic mediums which ain't as challenging to come up with. Just a single link and it's ready to interact with in real-time!Not too fancy and not too typical. Otherwise sudden change in the paradigm may overwhelm the viewer and the actual details which matter, will be lost. For more coolness added some 'Back in Black' music of which I have been always fond of ever since I watched Ironman :) Spline tool will be having most amazing use cases across industries going forward.Check out my portfolio - https://lnkd.in/fkcKBHfSome more 3D interactions - https://lnkd.in/dZwXgYFxMy Insta art account - https://lnkd.in/dfz7jXh7धन्यवाद 🙏 🇮🇳 #resume #interactiondesign #3dmodeling #3danimation #threejs #innovation #design #creative #music"

"How Nicotex Helped Me Overcome My Worst Habit and a Heartfelt Thanks to CiplaBreaking free from the clutches of a harmful addiction is no easy task. As someone who struggled with the grip of smoking, I understand the challenges and the strength it takes to break free from this habit. In my journey towards a healthier lifestyle, Nicotex, a revolutionary product from Cipla, played a pivotal role. In this article, I want to share my personal experience of how Nicotex helped me overcome my worst habit and express my heartfelt gratitude to Cipla for manufacturing such an effective solution.The Transition Phase:The journey of quitting smoking is not just about breaking the physical dependency; it also involves tackling the psychological aspects. Nicotex played a crucial role in both these aspects. The controlled nicotine release from the gum helped alleviate my cravings and reduced the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, the act of chewing Nicotex gum provided a substitute for the oral fixation associated with smoking.Gradual Reduction:Nicotex's unique feature of gradually reducing the nicotine content over time was instrumental in my journey. I started with the appropriate nicotine strength based on my smoking habits and gradually reduced it as per the recommended plan. This step-by-step approach allowed my body and mind to adjust to decreasing nicotine levels without experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.The Road to Freedom:After consistent efforts and with the aid of Nicotex, I finally managed to break free from the chains of smoking. The transformation I experienced in my overall health and well-being was remarkable. I felt a surge of energy that had been dulled for years. Quitting smoking has undoubtedly been one of the best decisions I have made for myself.Conclusion:Overcoming an addiction is a personal triumph that requires determination, support, and the right tools. Nicotex, with its unique formulation and gradual reduction approach, provided me with the necessary support to break free from the clutches of smoking. It not only helped manage my cravings but also played a vital role in addressing the psychological aspects of quitting. I wholeheartedly thank Cipla for their role in developing Nicotex and their unwavering commitment to helping individuals lead healthier lives. If you or someone you know is struggling with smoking, I highly recommend considering Nicotex as an effective aid in your journey towards a smoke-free life.#experience #energy #health #gratitude #transformation #smokingcessation #smoking #cipla #nicotine"

"Imagine if a company made water out of air. Uravu Labs did it.They’re making 1,000 litres of water out of thin air every single day.You may think this is impossible, but two students of NIT Calicut have made it possible.The story dates back to Uravu Labs founders Swapnil Shrivastav and Venkatesh RY's  college days when a drought-like situation forced them to think about the water scarcity problem. Hence, they were determined to find a sustainable solution to this prevailing problem. Water scarcity is a significant problem in our country. According to a report, water scarcity in India is expected to rise from 933 million in 2016 to 1.7 to 2.4 billion by 2050.This is an alarming situation, yet most people are unaware of it.→ Although water returned to the campus after a month, their thirst for solving the problem didn’t die. That’s how the water tech startup ‘Uravu Labs’ was founded in 2017.→ After months of research, they considered making water out of thin air. This process was familiar to the world- countries like Israel and the USA had already been making water with thin air. However, the production cost needed to be lowered, and according to the duo, high production costs were never an option. Hence, they needed to find another way.→ The duo tried and tested every possible way to make a crude prototype using air conditioners, car radiators, etc. But luck didn't seem to be on their side. By the time the product reached its minimum viable product (MVP) stage, the duo had graduated from college. However, no one was interested in their product- it didn't look promising.→ For two years, they did not get any chance. In between, they kept working on their product and were also able to make a crude prototype. This time luck was on their side. → Uravu Labs emerged as one of the top 5 finalists of the Tata Group-backed Water Abundance XPRIZE and was granted $50,000. This was enough to set up a unit and work on this project full-time.→ The duo welcomed Pardeep Garg and BALAJI GB as co-founders of the water tech startup in 2018.→ Uravu Labs plans to produce 1 lakh litres of water in the next 24 months, with its current capacity of 1,000 litres daily.Will Uravu Labs bring a permanent solution to the water scarcity problem that exists not only in India but also in the world?#tech #startup #waterconservation"
"📝🚀 Angular Interview Questions 🚀📝Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋 Are you looking to level up your Angular skills? Today, I wanted to share some helpful angular Interview questions that will enhance your understanding and productivity when working with Angular. Let's dive right in:1️⃣ TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Make sure you have a solid understanding of TypeScript concepts like classes, interfaces, and modules to leverage the full power of Angular.2️⃣ Components: Angular follows a component-based architecture. Each component encapsulates its own logic, HTML template, and styles. Remember to keep components small, focused, and reusable for easier maintenance and code organization.3️⃣ Data Binding: Angular provides powerful data binding capabilities. Use interpolation ({{ }}) for one-way data binding, and square brackets ([]) for property binding. Additionally, use parentheses (()) for event binding and two-way binding with the [(ngModel)] directive.4️⃣ Directives: Directives are a way to extend HTML with custom behavior. Angular provides built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngStyle. You can also create your own directives to manipulate the DOM or add custom functionality.5️⃣ Services: Services in Angular are singletons that provide shared functionality and data across components. Use services to handle business logic, API calls, and state management. Remember to inject services into components via dependency injection.6️⃣ Routing: Angular's powerful routing module allows you to build single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views. Configure routes using the RouterModule and navigate between views using the routerLink directive.7️⃣ Reactive Forms: When working with forms, Angular's reactive forms approach provides a robust solution. Use the FormBuilder and FormControl classes to create dynamic forms with validation and form state tracking.8️⃣ Lifecycle Hooks: Angular provides lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into component creation, rendering, and destruction. Explore hooks like ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, and ngOnDestroy to perform actions at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.9️⃣ Dependency Injection: Angular's dependency injection system is at the core of its architecture. Understand how to leverage it to provide and consume dependencies throughout your application.🔟 Testing: Angular has excellent support for testing. Use frameworks like Jasmine and tools like Karma or Jest to write unit tests for your components, services, and pipes. Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.If you found these notes helpful, don't forget to like and share. Feel free to connect with me Ashish Anand if you have any questions or want to discuss further.

"𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗷𝗮𝗹𝗶 𝗬𝗼𝗴𝗮 𝗦𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗮.𝗦𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝟮.योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः""Yoga is the suppression of the Compulsive Cyclical    Tendencies of the mind.""The second sutra of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is a foundational statement of the yogic path. It states that 𝒚𝒐𝒈𝒂 𝒊𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒑𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒃𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒍.The mind is constantly in flux, flitting from one thought to the next. This constant movement of the mind is what prevents us from achieving true peace and happiness. Yoga teaches us how to still the mind and focus our attention on the present moment. When we can do this, we can begin to experience the true nature of reality.The sutra goes on to say that there are eight limbs of yoga, which are the practices that help us to control the mind. These limbs are:Yama: moral restraintsNiyama: observancesAsana: posturesPranayama: breath controlPratyahara: withdrawal of the sensesDharana: concentrationDhyana: meditationSamadhi: absorptionThe eight limbs of yoga are not a linear path. We do not need to master all eight limbs in order to experience the benefits of yoga. We can start with any limb that we feel drawn to, and gradually work our way through the other limbs. The important thing is to practice regularly and to be patient. With time and effort, we can all learn to control the mind and achieve true peace and happiness.𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗬𝗼𝗴𝗮 𝗗𝗮𝘆.Follow me Sridhar Iyengar .Press the 🔔 icon.Video Social Media.#yogapractice #experience #happiness"

"Source Code for DragGAN has been finally released!!!Drag Your GAN: Allows users to precisely & interactively manipulate the shape, layout and pose of entities in the generated images [Interactive Point-based Manipulation on the Generative Image Manifold]Imagine this scenario: You're a skilled sports coach, and you have access to innovative technology based on this tool. With this, you can revolutionize the world of sports training and strategy by leveraging its advanced capabilities to create interactive and immersive simulations of competitive matches. This cutting-edge tool allows you to precisely manipulate gameplay, modify tactics, and even simulate varying environmental conditions to optimize your team's performance. By incorporating such a gameplay solution into your coaching process, you can refine strategies, enhance athletes' skills, and create compelling training experiences that give your team a competitive edge. One can have the unprecedented opportunity to transform sports coaching, empowering athletes to excel and achieve their full potential on the field.The flexibility allows for the creation of captivating transformations - morphing between different forms or reshaping landscapes.The researchers introduced an interactive technique in which users can drag any point in an image to a desired position, enabling precise control. This approach extends beyond specific categories and allows manipulation of diverse objects while maintaining realistic results even in complex scenarios like generating missing content and deforming shapes while preserving object rigidity.Author's Implementation: They perform motion supervision using shifted path loss on generator feature maps, which drives the handle points (red dots) to move towards the target points (blue dots) and the point tracking step updates the handle points to track the object in the image, this process continues until the handle points reach their corresponding target points.The Limitations highlighted in the paper include -potential artifacts when deviating from the training distribution and tracking drift in texture-less regions. Socially, it requires adherence to personality rights and privacy regulations to prevent misuse in creating manipulated images.Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2305.10973Github code: https://lnkd.in/eqFxudB2#artificialintelligence  #deeplearning #gans#technology"

"Quitting Amazon is a difficult decision, but it's finally here. Expressing gratitude to those who supported my journey.It’s always day one!"
"Shockingly, my master's and bachelor's degree, both aren't enough to get a job in the UK! I had very less time to prepare for my masters due to a delayed offer, but I did everything in 2 weeks, from visa to student loan and came to achieve my dreams.  I had faced so many difficulties during my course; I had someone steal my passport & BRP from my room, faced burnout, difficulty finding a house, rising costs, loneliness, and the list goes on...  I graduated in Dec 2022. I was barely surviving, financially unstable, anxious and burnout. During all of this I was giving my 100%, even though there were unimaginable difficulties. And even after graduating successfully, things only became worse.  Looking for a job as an international student (graduate) has been extremely heartbreaking. There has been no value for me, my degree, or capabilities. I have applied for more than 300+ jobs and got a handful of useful feedbacks. At times, I had to wait for months together after an interview only to have no reply or feedback. Hiring managers need to understand that these are not just job applications but that there are actual people behind these applications! We are talented and put a lot of effort into our applications and would really would really appreciate some feedback! I feel as an international student, we go through a lot. Being away from family, taking care of ourselves, dealing with burnout and stress, all while doing a master’s degree. All this is not easy! We international students are talented, capable, and more than anything RESILIENT. Our determination to come back up and achieve things is impeccable.   If you are someone who moved out from your home country and tried to figure it all out on your own, I have immense respect for you!  I'm hoping things change and people GIVE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS A CHANCE!  I came here exhausted, worried, and terrified. I'm still having trouble finding a job, just like many of my fellow international students. But I feel secure in my personal development and how far I've come!

"Imagine if a company made water out of air. Uravu Labs did it.They’re making 1,000 litres of water out of thin air every single day.You may think this is impossible, but two students of NIT Calicut have made it possible.The story dates back to Uravu Labs founders Swapnil Shrivastav and Venkatesh RY's  college days when a drought-like situation forced them to think about the water scarcity problem. Hence, they were determined to find a sustainable solution to this prevailing problem. Water scarcity is a significant problem in our country. According to a report, water scarcity in India is expected to rise from 933 million in 2016 to 1.7 to 2.4 billion by 2050.This is an alarming situation, yet most people are unaware of it.→ Although water returned to the campus after a month, their thirst for solving the problem didn’t die. That’s how the water tech startup ‘Uravu Labs’ was founded in 2017.→ After months of research, they considered making water out of thin air. This process was familiar to the world- countries like Israel and the USA had already been making water with thin air. However, the production cost needed to be lowered, and according to the duo, high production costs were never an option. Hence, they needed to find another way.→ The duo tried and tested every possible way to make a crude prototype using air conditioners, car radiators, etc. But luck didn't seem to be on their side. By the time the product reached its minimum viable product (MVP) stage, the duo had graduated from college. However, no one was interested in their product- it didn't look promising.→ For two years, they did not get any chance. In between, they kept working on their product and were also able to make a crude prototype. This time luck was on their side. → Uravu Labs emerged as one of the top 5 finalists of the Tata Group-backed Water Abundance XPRIZE and was granted $50,000. This was enough to set up a unit and work on this project full-time.→ The duo welcomed Pardeep Garg and BALAJI GB as co-founders of the water tech startup in 2018.→ Uravu Labs plans to produce 1 lakh litres of water in the next 24 months, with its current capacity of 1,000 litres daily.Will Uravu Labs bring a permanent solution to the water scarcity problem that exists not only in India but also in the world?#tech #startup #waterconservation"
"My friends and colleagues would tell you that being impacted by the recent Meta #layoffs has been mentally rough for me, but here's to trying to move forward with grace - I think it's important to recognize that in the society we live in, employment is a privilege, not a right - though certainly it should be both. That we are ultimately viewed as a statistic in the face of critical business decisions is an inevitable corporate reality, especially in big tech companies. While undoubtedly frustrating, such decisions are ultimately impersonal, and it is not lost on me that to have had Meta as my first job, and to have found employment outside Manila, has been in itself a massive privilege.There is a very long list of things to be grateful for. On top of that list, as my manager would say, is the people. The one truth that has remained constant throughout each chapter of my life is that my community makes me, and I am immensely grateful for the people I've worked with, grown with, and learned from both professionally and personally. The job might not always last, but the people and the impact they make on us are there to stay forever. So this is a massive thank you to my manager, my team, my cross-functionals, and my friends, who have collectively made my experience at Meta as meaningful as it was, no matter how short.I'm excited to embark on the next chapter of my career, and I would appreciate any support from my network, particularly through the following:👉🏼 Leads, recommendations, or referrals for jobs you think I might be suited for (i.e. project management, risk management, vendor management, ops roles in tech) 👉🏼 Profile recommendations and skill endorsements from the people I've worked with👉🏼 Reactions and comments on my post for extended reachPlease feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or email at ng.jerome.c@gmail.com for any recommendations, opportunities, or even a chat over coffee if you're going through something similar! Thanks so much for your support! 💪🏼"

"JUGGERNAUTThere’s a lot we can know about a word, just by going deep into the origin of the word, and how it was formed. For example, the word “tamarind” is derived from the Arabic word “Tamar-e-hind” meaning “dates from India”. Just by looking into the origin of this word, we can infer that it was an entity transferred from India to Arab region.Similarly, the word “Juggernaut” means “a huge, powerful, and overwhelming force”. More interesting is the origin of the word “Juggernaut”. It originates from the Sanskrit word Jaggannath, and was derived from the event of Jaggannath rath yatra, where the idols of Mahaprabhu is carried in an enormous carriage.ଜୟ ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ | জয় জগন্নাথ | Jai Jaggannath"
"Indeed, pencil art can be incredibly beautiful.The fine lines, delicate shading, and intricate details created through pencil drawings can evoke a sense of elegance, realism, and artistic expression.Pencil art has a unique charm that captures the essence of the subject matter and showcases the skill and creativity of the artist.The monochromatic nature of pencil drawings allows for a focus on form, texture, and contrast, which can result in visually stunning artwork.Whether it's a portrait capturing the emotions and nuances of a person's face, a still life drawing with intricate details and textures of objects, or a landscape conveying a sense of depth and atmosphere, pencil art has the ability to captivate viewers and evoke an emotional response.Moreover, pencil art offers a timeless quality. The black and white tones and the classic look of pencil drawings can transcend trends and fads, allowing them to maintain their beauty and relevance over time.Whether it's the realism, the expressive lines, or the artistic interpretation, pencil art indeed possesses a unique beauty that continues to captivate and inspire both artists and art enthusiasts alike.Follow Harshit Srivastava for more such creative content!#art #artist #creativity #pencildrawing #artwork"
"I saw it coming.The signs were there and team members were getting deactivated. This wasn't like my first layoff. That one was filled with emotion, confusion, and shame.This one I understood. Nobody wants to lay off their team, especially at small startups. But business is business, and my time had come.I spent my last few minutes making up a custom background. I waited until the point in the call when it was official (because imagine how awkward that would be if I wasn't being laid off...), and then I uploaded this ""in memoriam"" background. It was well received ( 🙏 ) and I was able to use my last few moments how I wanted: to say what I needed to say, to express my gratitude for 4 years of learning and development. To be truly present in the call and have a meaningful final sign-off.I don't think this will be my last layoff. ""In this economy"" it feels inevitable. But I know that my accomplishments and worth aren't tied to this decision. I can be proud of the professional growth I accomplished and be grateful for the team that took the journey with me.Now I just need to find the next team that will appreciate my sense of humor as much as this one did. 🥁 ---If you know of anyone hiring for a marketing manager, my areas of focus include content, lifecycle, community, and brand!

"Multiple ways to fetch API in React You Should Know! #react The choice of which method to use depends on your project requirements, preferences, and the complexity of your data-fetching needs.1.Build in fetch function: The Fetch API is a built-in web API in modern browsers that allows making HTTP requests. You can use the fetch() function to fetch data from an API endpoint. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response object, which you can handle using .then() and .catch(). #complexity #project #data 2.Axios: Axios is a popular third-party library for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and convenient API for fetching data. You can install Axios using npm or yarn, and then use it to send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., requests to your API endpoints.It helps to deliver payload without writing less code then Typical fetch method also there is interseptor function that helps to handle error easily.#axios 3.XMLHttpRequest: The XMLHttpRequest object is a traditional way of making HTTP requests. While it’s a lower-level API compared to Fetch and Axios, it’s still widely supported. You can use new XMLHttpRequest() to create an instance, set up event listeners, and call methods like open(), send(), and onreadystatechange to handle the response.#xml 4.React Query/Tanstack Query: React Query is a powerful data-fetching library specifically designed for React applications. It provides hooks and utilities to manage and cache API data, handle data fetching, caching, pagination, and more. React Query simplifies the process of fetching and managing API data with built-in features like caching,isLoading, refetching, and background data synchronization.It also use for large application where multiple data need to fetch multiple components.You can set the base url to the hook then call the hook in the component then fetch the data easily. #tanstackquery #reactquery 5.GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language that allows you to request specific data from an API endpoint. It provides a flexible and efficient way of fetching data, allowing the client to define the structure of the response. You can use libraries like Apollo Client or Relay to integrate GraphQL into your React application.#graphql"

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"My Off-Campus Amazon Interview Experience:I applied through a referral from a college senior, which undoubtedly expedited my application process.A few weeks after applying, I received a link to an online assessment test, which took place on the Hackerrank platform. The assessment consisted of two coding questions that were intricately linked to Amazon's day-to-day operations. I was able to tackle the problems using Breadth First Search and priority queues. After a brief period, I received a call informing me that I had successfully passed the online assessment round. Then the onsite rounds were scheduled, which were conducted virtually using Amazon's internal tools. Round-1: The initial round was a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) round. The interviewer began by asking me to introduce myself and shared insights about his team. We then delved into two problem-solving exercises, one involving trees and the other centred around graphs. I confidently presented my solutions and discussed the time and space complexities associated with each approach. Round-2: This round, too, was focused on DSA. I was presented with two problems, for which I provided a greedy solution for the first and a hashmap solution for the second. To ensure clarity, I conducted dry runs on the inputs provided by the interviewer. Once again, we discussed the time and space complexities of both solutions.Round-3: The subsequent round was the Hiring Manager interview. The interviewer reviewed my resume, seeking deeper insights into my background. We engaged in a productive conversation that explored various aspects of my experience. Furthermore, the interviewer presented me with a design question. I provided client-side and server-side solutions.Note: For SDE-1 positions, in most companies including Amazon, design questions are not asked. I communicated it to the HM and he acknowledged it in the interview round itself.Round-4: The final round was the Bar Raiser interview, where I faced two additional DSA problems. I confidently presented my solutions and explained the time and space complexities associated with each one. Towards the end of the interview, the interviewer delved into behavioural questions.Note: The sequence of the Bar Raiser and Hiring Manager rounds may vary in different cases.If you're eager to learn more about interview tips or want to discuss any aspects of my experience, feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or on topmate.io.

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"

"Why work from home is better than office.....Sometimes you are not well properly. Work from the office you can not able to manage all things but work from home you can manage all .One of the major positives of working from home is the elimination of commute. On an average, people in India spend at least 2 hours in a day, traveling to and from work. This not only wastes time they could otherwise be spending productively, it also hampers work-life balance greatly. #workfromhome  #work #angelone"

"Happy Monday Morning, network! It's taken me a while to make a post, but back in March I was one of the masses that was affected by Meta's layoffs. Getting that email - my heart sunk. I dodged the first rounds of layoffs, and was so hopeful I would get to keep my dream job. But when that morning did come, that email stung more than I expected it to.The past few months have been harder than I anticipated. Part of me believed that working at Meta and having a stellar track record would help me glide into my next role, but it wasn't long before I realized that I was up against many of my extremely talented colleagues and friends in every interview I went into.It's a challenge to make yourself stick out or when so many of us in the same industry are reaching for help. Heck, I even feel bold enough to tag my former manager James Hudson to testify to my abilities! (Side note, if you ever get managed by James, you might be one of the luckiest people out there)So here I am, y'all!

"Micro-Manage is Micro-Damage to the Culture. Dynamic and Agile leader should never Micro-manage.Recent article in TOI suggests the same Not micro-managing your team can bring several advantages:1. Employee Empowerment: By avoiding micro-management, you allow your team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions. This promotes a sense of empowerment, boosts their confidence, and encourages creativity and innovation.2. Improved Productivity: When employees have autonomy and the freedom to work in their own style, they can utilize their skills and expertise more effectively. This often leads to increased productivity as they can focus on their work without unnecessary interruptions or rigid controls.3. Enhanced Morale and Engagement: Trusting your team to handle their tasks without constant supervision fosters a positive work environment. It shows that you value their abilities and trust them to deliver results. This can improve employee morale, job satisfaction, and overall engagement.4. Professional Growth: Micromanagement can stifle professional growth as it limits employees' opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Allowing individuals to take on challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them promotes continuous learning and personal growth within the team.5. Time Management: By refraining from excessive monitoring, you can allocate your time more effectively. Rather than focusing on minute details, you can concentrate on strategic planning, building relationships, and addressing larger organizational goals.6. Collaboration and Teamwork: A non-micromanaging approach encourages collaboration and teamwork. When employees have the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and contribute to the decision-making process, it strengthens the overall dynamics of the team and promotes a culture of collaboration.7. Retention and Recruitment: A supportive work environment with less micro-management tends to attract and retain talented employees. Professionals seek autonomy, trust, and opportunities for growth. By offering these qualities, you can build a strong team and reduce turnover.Remember, effective leadership involves providing guidance, setting clear expectations, and being available for support when needed, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to thrive."

"Imagine if a company made water out of air. Uravu Labs did it.They’re making 1,000 litres of water out of thin air every single day.You may think this is impossible, but two students of NIT Calicut have made it possible.The story dates back to Uravu Labs founders Swapnil Shrivastav and Venkatesh RY's  college days when a drought-like situation forced them to think about the water scarcity problem. Hence, they were determined to find a sustainable solution to this prevailing problem. Water scarcity is a significant problem in our country. According to a report, water scarcity in India is expected to rise from 933 million in 2016 to 1.7 to 2.4 billion by 2050.This is an alarming situation, yet most people are unaware of it.→ Although water returned to the campus after a month, their thirst for solving the problem didn’t die. That’s how the water tech startup ‘Uravu Labs’ was founded in 2017.→ After months of research, they considered making water out of thin air. This process was familiar to the world- countries like Israel and the USA had already been making water with thin air. However, the production cost needed to be lowered, and according to the duo, high production costs were never an option. Hence, they needed to find another way.→ The duo tried and tested every possible way to make a crude prototype using air conditioners, car radiators, etc. But luck didn't seem to be on their side. By the time the product reached its minimum viable product (MVP) stage, the duo had graduated from college. However, no one was interested in their product- it didn't look promising.→ For two years, they did not get any chance. In between, they kept working on their product and were also able to make a crude prototype. This time luck was on their side. → Uravu Labs emerged as one of the top 5 finalists of the Tata Group-backed Water Abundance XPRIZE and was granted $50,000. This was enough to set up a unit and work on this project full-time.→ The duo welcomed Pardeep Garg and BALAJI GB as co-founders of the water tech startup in 2018.→ Uravu Labs plans to produce 1 lakh litres of water in the next 24 months, with its current capacity of 1,000 litres daily.Will Uravu Labs bring a permanent solution to the water scarcity problem that exists not only in India but also in the world?#tech #startup #waterconservation"

"What happens when something fearful is in front of you?What is your instant reaction?Do you feel like turning your back, and run away?▪️Fear, and anxiety are closely related.When you experience an unknown threat, you get anxious; whereas, you get afraid when you find something dangerous, which is known to you.▪️Some people remain afraid all the time. This is a symptom of anxiety disorder. It stems from chronic stress.▪️In some extreme cases, like in the case of Agoraphobia -- a type of anxiety disorder, people start avoiding situations or places, which are associated with unpleasant experiences or memories. They're afraid that, they might get trapped, or have a panic attack. ▪️Fight your fears. Don't run away.▪️These are simple ways to address your fears 👇🏼⏺️ Breathe -- deep breathing.⏺️ Confess to yourself that you're afraid, and anxious or stressed.⏺️ Think of something beautiful.⏺️ Ask yourself what is making you uncomfortable -- is it FEAR or F.E.A.R.  (False Evidence Appearing Real)?▪️Watch this video. A giant whale is almost near to the woman. Her body language shows that, she's not at all afraid. See she is totally calm, and composed.▪️Of course this doesn't happen naturally to everyone. But everyone can try to fight fear, and anxiety. It needs will, eagerness, and practice. ▪️Regular practice of Yoga and meditation helps.In case of anxiety disorder, psychotherapy or / and medications are needed.▪️DISCLAIMER_______________Video rights belong to the owner.

"Why work from home is better than office.....Sometimes you are not well properly. Work from the office you can not able to manage all things but work from home you can manage all .One of the major positives of working from home is the elimination of commute. On an average, people in India spend at least 2 hours in a day, traveling to and from work. This not only wastes time they could otherwise be spending productively, it also hampers work-life balance greatly. #workfromhome  #work #angelone"
"How Nicotex Helped Me Overcome My Worst Habit and a Heartfelt Thanks to CiplaBreaking free from the clutches of a harmful addiction is no easy task. As someone who struggled with the grip of smoking, I understand the challenges and the strength it takes to break free from this habit. In my journey towards a healthier lifestyle, Nicotex, a revolutionary product from Cipla, played a pivotal role. In this article, I want to share my personal experience of how Nicotex helped me overcome my worst habit and express my heartfelt gratitude to Cipla for manufacturing such an effective solution.The Transition Phase:The journey of quitting smoking is not just about breaking the physical dependency; it also involves tackling the psychological aspects. Nicotex played a crucial role in both these aspects. The controlled nicotine release from the gum helped alleviate my cravings and reduced the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, the act of chewing Nicotex gum provided a substitute for the oral fixation associated with smoking.Gradual Reduction:Nicotex's unique feature of gradually reducing the nicotine content over time was instrumental in my journey. I started with the appropriate nicotine strength based on my smoking habits and gradually reduced it as per the recommended plan. This step-by-step approach allowed my body and mind to adjust to decreasing nicotine levels without experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.The Road to Freedom:After consistent efforts and with the aid of Nicotex, I finally managed to break free from the chains of smoking. The transformation I experienced in my overall health and well-being was remarkable. I felt a surge of energy that had been dulled for years. Quitting smoking has undoubtedly been one of the best decisions I have made for myself.Conclusion:Overcoming an addiction is a personal triumph that requires determination, support, and the right tools. Nicotex, with its unique formulation and gradual reduction approach, provided me with the necessary support to break free from the clutches of smoking. It not only helped manage my cravings but also played a vital role in addressing the psychological aspects of quitting. I wholeheartedly thank Cipla for their role in developing Nicotex and their unwavering commitment to helping individuals lead healthier lives. If you or someone you know is struggling with smoking, I highly recommend considering Nicotex as an effective aid in your journey towards a smoke-free life.#experience #energy #health #gratitude #transformation #smokingcessation #smoking #cipla #nicotine"

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"
"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"Imagine if a company made water out of air. Uravu Labs did it.They’re making 1,000 litres of water out of thin air every single day.You may think this is impossible, but two students of NIT Calicut have made it possible.The story dates back to Uravu Labs founders Swapnil Shrivastav and Venkatesh RY's  college days when a drought-like situation forced them to think about the water scarcity problem. Hence, they were determined to find a sustainable solution to this prevailing problem. Water scarcity is a significant problem in our country. According to a report, water scarcity in India is expected to rise from 933 million in 2016 to 1.7 to 2.4 billion by 2050.This is an alarming situation, yet most people are unaware of it.→ Although water returned to the campus after a month, their thirst for solving the problem didn’t die. That’s how the water tech startup ‘Uravu Labs’ was founded in 2017.→ After months of research, they considered making water out of thin air. This process was familiar to the world- countries like Israel and the USA had already been making water with thin air. However, the production cost needed to be lowered, and according to the duo, high production costs were never an option. Hence, they needed to find another way.→ The duo tried and tested every possible way to make a crude prototype using air conditioners, car radiators, etc. But luck didn't seem to be on their side. By the time the product reached its minimum viable product (MVP) stage, the duo had graduated from college. However, no one was interested in their product- it didn't look promising.→ For two years, they did not get any chance. In between, they kept working on their product and were also able to make a crude prototype. This time luck was on their side. → Uravu Labs emerged as one of the top 5 finalists of the Tata Group-backed Water Abundance XPRIZE and was granted $50,000. This was enough to set up a unit and work on this project full-time.→ The duo welcomed Pardeep Garg and BALAJI GB as co-founders of the water tech startup in 2018.→ Uravu Labs plans to produce 1 lakh litres of water in the next 24 months, with its current capacity of 1,000 litres daily.Will Uravu Labs bring a permanent solution to the water scarcity problem that exists not only in India but also in the world?#tech #startup #waterconservation"

"Micro-Manage is Micro-Damage to the Culture. Dynamic and Agile leader should never Micro-manage.Recent article in TOI suggests the same Not micro-managing your team can bring several advantages:1. Employee Empowerment: By avoiding micro-management, you allow your team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions. This promotes a sense of empowerment, boosts their confidence, and encourages creativity and innovation.2. Improved Productivity: When employees have autonomy and the freedom to work in their own style, they can utilize their skills and expertise more effectively. This often leads to increased productivity as they can focus on their work without unnecessary interruptions or rigid controls.3. Enhanced Morale and Engagement: Trusting your team to handle their tasks without constant supervision fosters a positive work environment. It shows that you value their abilities and trust them to deliver results. This can improve employee morale, job satisfaction, and overall engagement.4. Professional Growth: Micromanagement can stifle professional growth as it limits employees' opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Allowing individuals to take on challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them promotes continuous learning and personal growth within the team.5. Time Management: By refraining from excessive monitoring, you can allocate your time more effectively. Rather than focusing on minute details, you can concentrate on strategic planning, building relationships, and addressing larger organizational goals.6. Collaboration and Teamwork: A non-micromanaging approach encourages collaboration and teamwork. When employees have the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and contribute to the decision-making process, it strengthens the overall dynamics of the team and promotes a culture of collaboration.7. Retention and Recruitment: A supportive work environment with less micro-management tends to attract and retain talented employees. Professionals seek autonomy, trust, and opportunities for growth. By offering these qualities, you can build a strong team and reduce turnover.Remember, effective leadership involves providing guidance, setting clear expectations, and being available for support when needed, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to thrive."

"NLP IMPORTANT NOTES 📝 “Unlocking the Power of Natural Language Processing (NLP): Harnessing the Future of Communication. 🚀✨In today's digital era, NLP is revolutionizing how we interact with technology and enabling machines to understand human language. As an AI language model, I've witnessed firsthand the incredible impact NLP has on our lives.Imagine having a personal assistant that can comprehend and respond to your voice commands accurately, like Amazon Alexa or Apple's Siri. NLP makes this possible by analyzing and interpreting human language, making our interactions with technology more seamless and intuitive.But NLP goes beyond virtual assistants. It has applications in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, customer service, and more. For example, NLP algorithms can extract vital information from medical records, helping doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses. It can also assist businesses in analyzing customer feedback to improve their products and services.As NLP continues to evolve, its potential for transforming our daily lives is limitless.

"Indeed, pencil art can be incredibly beautiful.The fine lines, delicate shading, and intricate details created through pencil drawings can evoke a sense of elegance, realism, and artistic expression.Pencil art has a unique charm that captures the essence of the subject matter and showcases the skill and creativity of the artist.The monochromatic nature of pencil drawings allows for a focus on form, texture, and contrast, which can result in visually stunning artwork.Whether it's a portrait capturing the emotions and nuances of a person's face, a still life drawing with intricate details and textures of objects, or a landscape conveying a sense of depth and atmosphere, pencil art has the ability to captivate viewers and evoke an emotional response.Moreover, pencil art offers a timeless quality. The black and white tones and the classic look of pencil drawings can transcend trends and fads, allowing them to maintain their beauty and relevance over time.Whether it's the realism, the expressive lines, or the artistic interpretation, pencil art indeed possesses a unique beauty that continues to captivate and inspire both artists and art enthusiasts alike.Follow Harshit Srivastava for more such creative content!#art #artist #creativity #pencildrawing #artwork"

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"Back to back interviews.Not a single candidate was meeting the expectations of the jury. Everyone seemed underconfident and nervous. Those who were confident didn't have the skills and practical knowledge. We were heading towards the end of the hiring session.Then a guy entered, he was a fresher and seemed very confident from his body language.As the interview went on, he performed really well.Me : ""How did you prepare yourself for the interview?""Candidate : ""I used to do mock interviews with other candidates.""I was very impressed with this habit of the candidate. Mock interview sessions really help the candidate to develop confidence and good answering skills.He was hired !Whenever you are preparing for an interview always try to practice the probable questions and participate in mock interviews.

"I feel sympathy for the 22,500 employees of Credit Suisse who are about to lose their jobs https://lnkd.in/gS575ai9.  Some of them have no doubt lost a significant portion of their savings also, due to 401k plan investments, deferred compensation, etc.  At one time, Credit Suisse was a world-class firm, highly regarded by competitors and customers alike.  And in different ways, this will be a painful, awful experience for all CS former employees living through this transition, just as it was for the thousands of people (myself included) who lost their jobs when Bear Stearns hit the wall in 2008.  Nobody likes losing their job, but when a firm collapses in ignominious fashion, it is especially difficult.  As with the Bear collapse and the Lehman bankruptcy, reputations have been damaged.  But you are not your firm, and you are not your firm's incompetent management (unless you are, in fact, the management, in which case you should be ashamed of yourselves).   Wall Street is great at creative destruction, so if you work hard, remain modest, and focus on your customers, you will be able to rebuild your career.   #creditsuisse #ubs #layoffs #wallstreet #transitions"

An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"Micro-Manage is Micro-Damage to the Culture. Dynamic and Agile leader should never Micro-manage.Recent article in TOI suggests the same Not micro-managing your team can bring several advantages:1. Employee Empowerment: By avoiding micro-management, you allow your team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions. This promotes a sense of empowerment, boosts their confidence, and encourages creativity and innovation.2. Improved Productivity: When employees have autonomy and the freedom to work in their own style, they can utilize their skills and expertise more effectively. This often leads to increased productivity as they can focus on their work without unnecessary interruptions or rigid controls.3. Enhanced Morale and Engagement: Trusting your team to handle their tasks without constant supervision fosters a positive work environment. It shows that you value their abilities and trust them to deliver results. This can improve employee morale, job satisfaction, and overall engagement.4. Professional Growth: Micromanagement can stifle professional growth as it limits employees' opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Allowing individuals to take on challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them promotes continuous learning and personal growth within the team.5. Time Management: By refraining from excessive monitoring, you can allocate your time more effectively. Rather than focusing on minute details, you can concentrate on strategic planning, building relationships, and addressing larger organizational goals.6. Collaboration and Teamwork: A non-micromanaging approach encourages collaboration and teamwork. When employees have the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and contribute to the decision-making process, it strengthens the overall dynamics of the team and promotes a culture of collaboration.7. Retention and Recruitment: A supportive work environment with less micro-management tends to attract and retain talented employees. Professionals seek autonomy, trust, and opportunities for growth. By offering these qualities, you can build a strong team and reduce turnover.Remember, effective leadership involves providing guidance, setting clear expectations, and being available for support when needed, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to thrive."
"What happens when something fearful is in front of you?What is your instant reaction?Do you feel like turning your back, and run away?▪️Fear, and anxiety are closely related.When you experience an unknown threat, you get anxious; whereas, you get afraid when you find something dangerous, which is known to you.▪️Some people remain afraid all the time. This is a symptom of anxiety disorder. It stems from chronic stress.▪️In some extreme cases, like in the case of Agoraphobia -- a type of anxiety disorder, people start avoiding situations or places, which are associated with unpleasant experiences or memories. They're afraid that, they might get trapped, or have a panic attack. ▪️Fight your fears. Don't run away.▪️These are simple ways to address your fears 👇🏼⏺️ Breathe -- deep breathing.⏺️ Confess to yourself that you're afraid, and anxious or stressed.⏺️ Think of something beautiful.⏺️ Ask yourself what is making you uncomfortable -- is it FEAR or F.E.A.R.  (False Evidence Appearing Real)?▪️Watch this video. A giant whale is almost near to the woman. Her body language shows that, she's not at all afraid. See she is totally calm, and composed.▪️Of course this doesn't happen naturally to everyone. But everyone can try to fight fear, and anxiety. It needs will, eagerness, and practice. ▪️Regular practice of Yoga and meditation helps.In case of anxiety disorder, psychotherapy or / and medications are needed.▪️DISCLAIMER_______________Video rights belong to the owner.

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"""When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you are not saying 'no' to yourself."" – Paulo Coelho

People-pleasing, over time, can lead to an unhealthy dynamic. Here's why:

1.	Dilution of Authenticity: Being in constant people-pleasing mode can suppress our authentic selves. 
2.	Assertiveness is Key: Learn to express our thoughts and stand our ground respectfully. It's okay to disagree and voice our opinions when necessary. 
3.	Learn to Say 'No': Learn to decline politely yet firmly.
4.	Recognize Our Worth: Don't undervalue ourselves. Recognize our worth, and others will too.
5.	Set Boundaries: Clearly defined boundaries can prevent others from infringing on our time and responsibilities. 

Much ❤️, Sanjiv Beri

"🌍✈️ Embrace the Journey: Travel - A Gateway to Personal and Professional Growth! ✈️🌍Greetings, LinkedIn fam! Today, I want to celebrate the incredible power of travel and its profound impact on personal and professional growth. Whether you're a seasoned globetrotter or an aspiring adventurer, there's no denying that travel holds the key to unlocking a world of opportunities and experiences.1️⃣ Broadened Horizons: When we step out of our comfort zones and immerse ourselves in different cultures, landscapes, and perspectives, we open our minds to a whole new world of possibilities. Travel introduces us to diverse ways of life, customs, and traditions, fostering empathy and understanding that transcend borders.2️⃣ Adaptability and Resilience: From navigating unfamiliar streets to communicating in foreign languages, every journey presents unique challenges that require adaptability and resilience. Traveling forces us to think on our feet, problem-solve, and embrace unexpected situations with grace.3️⃣ Networking and Collaboration: Travel offers a myriad of opportunities to connect with people from different backgrounds and industries. Whether it's striking up a conversation with fellow travelers at a hostel or attending international conferences and events, these interactions can lead to valuable connections and collaborations. Who knows? Your next career breakthrough or innovative partnership might just be a flight away!4️⃣ Creativity and Inspiration: Exposing ourselves to new landscapes, architectures, art, and cultures can ignite our creativity and fuel our inspiration. The sights, sounds, and experiences we encounter during our travels can spark fresh ideas, enhance problem-solving skills, and provide a wellspring of inspiration for professional endeavors. So, pack your bags and let your imagination soar!5️⃣ Self-Discovery and Personal Growth: Travel often takes us out of our comfort zones and allows us to discover hidden facets of ourselves. It challenges us to face fears, push boundaries, and embrace personal growth. Whether it's conquering a hiking trail, trying local delicacies, or simply navigating through unfamiliar territory, each adventure becomes an opportunity for self-discovery and self-confidence.As we slowly emerge from a challenging period in history, let's remember the transformative power of travel. Whether it's exploring your own backyard or embarking on a cross-continental expedition, let curiosity be your compass and embrace the lessons that travel has to offer.🗺️ So, let's connect and share our travel stories, insights, and aspirations. Together, we can inspire and empower one another to embark on transformative journeys that shape not only our careers but also our lives.✈️🌍 Let's seize the world, one adventure at a time! 🌍✈️Thank you Aakanksha Monga for inspiring me and the world. 🌻#TravelTales #PersonalGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment #Networking #Inspiration #GlobalMindset"

"Micro-Manage is Micro-Damage to the Culture. Dynamic and Agile leader should never Micro-manage.Recent article in TOI suggests the same Not micro-managing your team can bring several advantages:1. Employee Empowerment: By avoiding micro-management, you allow your team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions. This promotes a sense of empowerment, boosts their confidence, and encourages creativity and innovation.2. Improved Productivity: When employees have autonomy and the freedom to work in their own style, they can utilize their skills and expertise more effectively. This often leads to increased productivity as they can focus on their work without unnecessary interruptions or rigid controls.3. Enhanced Morale and Engagement: Trusting your team to handle their tasks without constant supervision fosters a positive work environment. It shows that you value their abilities and trust them to deliver results. This can improve employee morale, job satisfaction, and overall engagement.4. Professional Growth: Micromanagement can stifle professional growth as it limits employees' opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Allowing individuals to take on challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them promotes continuous learning and personal growth within the team.5. Time Management: By refraining from excessive monitoring, you can allocate your time more effectively. Rather than focusing on minute details, you can concentrate on strategic planning, building relationships, and addressing larger organizational goals.6. Collaboration and Teamwork: A non-micromanaging approach encourages collaboration and teamwork. When employees have the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and contribute to the decision-making process, it strengthens the overall dynamics of the team and promotes a culture of collaboration.7. Retention and Recruitment: A supportive work environment with less micro-management tends to attract and retain talented employees. Professionals seek autonomy, trust, and opportunities for growth. By offering these qualities, you can build a strong team and reduce turnover.Remember, effective leadership involves providing guidance, setting clear expectations, and being available for support when needed, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to thrive."
"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain – this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either. Those two and a half weeks of labor would be my last in the agricultural realm. I wasn't ready for content work yet, but I was one step closer.❦ Let me know if you are looking for a UX/Content Design Leader, as I'm #opentowork! #layoffs #uxwriter #contentdesign #productdesign #UXdesign #contentstrategy ❦"

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"

"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control! Ask yourself, what am I so attached to that causes me on-going suffering & see if you can do the work to release it!!! If we do not learn how to connect the dots properly, we suffer from disconnect & that disconnect does not serve us...

"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"
"As the Menace of Layoffs is continuing and we are hearing about so many of our friends and peers loosing their jobs. I am of the opinion that more than the layoffs, it is untimely and unexpected ask by the organisation to leave when we are completely dependent on it without any backup or preparedness. Unfortunately in the last one week, I have received so many calls from the known and unknown sharing the bitter truth of them getting laid-off, looking for opportunities or an ideal to-do list to find a job. I am a firm believer that continuous efforts and constant learning in our careers will help us in the long term to become resilient.In the light of these developments, I would like to jot down few steps that have helped me and few of my other friends for a career transition or finding an ideal job or a new job search :1) Planning your career and Priorities well in advance : It is always important to have a long term plan of your career, understanding your top priorities in choosing a career and having a mental plan of how you look at your career for a decade or more will help in showing you way forward and taking the right next step in the direction2) CV That reflects and Speaks for you : CV is the first key to the door of opportunities. Invest time and efforts, if needed take help in making a CV that truly reflects your skills, expertise and achievements. It should be able to capture the attention of both the smartness of the systems and eye of the employer3) Constant Learning & Development : There are abundance of platforms that help working professionals to upgrade their knowledge by learning and developing in their core domain or interested areas to increase their credibility as a professional. 2 Hours of Learning every week can make your more resilient. Short term courses and Certifications do help and keep you above others.4) Network is Power : Great Network is always half work done. Investing time in growing your network, reaching out to the right people can help you to find your dream job even faster. A good network also helps in exchange of great knowledge and ideas.5) Finding a Job is a Process : It is not a luck or a by chance thing. Finding a job is a process and it will have its ups and down but surely learning all the way. Thus, one has to believe in the process, learn from it, be persistent and hopeful.6)Having a Mentor : Sometimes all it takes is a right conversation, little guidance or a small advise to boost your confidence and help you during low times. Thus having a good mentor is always like having a cheat code in a tough game. I Would be privileged if I can be of any help to anyone in their careers and always welcome everyone to learn, unite and grow together.I would love to hear from others if there is anything else that can help our friends in finding a new job or in building a resilient career during these testing times.#JobSearch #CareerAdvice #ProfessionalNetworking #layoffs #learning #people"

"Naya season ho ya controversy- Shark Tank is always in limelight.We are a Shark Tank funded startup ourselves and we are not in favor of the recent show related controversies!I understand and respect other people’s differing opinions. But, I wanted to share this to make sure every person knows the other side of the coin as well!As audience, you just see the grand pitch and handing over of the cheque. But in reality, a lot goes on behind the stage. ✅ You have to go through a long due diligence process! And if you can’t give solid proof of the claims you have made- Why would the sharks go ahead with the deal? Think for yourself- Would you invest in someone if you can’t trust them? ✅ People have spread rumors that the sharks ghost you. I don’t stand by this statement. Personally, Aman Gupta is the best thing that could have happened to the company. We're extremely grateful to him and his team for the constant support.I have personally seen businesses get the much needed exposure with the help of sharks. Another point to think- The sharks can’t always be at your beck and call,  right?Simple hai- Commitment comes from both sides! I have seen businesses reap benefits just after the registration process. The show helps businesses look at their business from a different approach! ZOFF will always be thankful to the show for providing us with such an amazing platform. P.s.- A huge shout out to the whole shark tank team for taking entrepreneurship in India to the next level and making startups a dinner table conversation. Thank you to the sharks for giving in so much of their time to the show and to budding entrepreneurs.

But, I wanted to share this to make sure every person knows the other side of the coin as well!As audience, you just see the grand pitch and handing over of the cheque. But in reality, a lot goes on behind the stage. ✅ You have to go through a long due diligence process! And if you can’t give solid proof of the claims you have made- Why would the sharks go ahead with the deal? Think for yourself- Would you invest in someone if you can’t trust them? ✅ People have spread rumors that the sharks ghost you. I don’t stand by this statement. Personally, Aman Gupta is the best thing that could have happened to the company. We're extremely grateful to him and his team for the constant support.I have personally seen businesses get the much needed exposure with the help of sharks. Another point to think- The sharks can’t always be at your beck and call,  right?Simple hai- Commitment comes from both sides! I have seen businesses reap benefits just after the registration process. The show helps businesses look at their business from a different approach! ZOFF will always be thankful to the show for providing us with such an amazing platform. P.s.- A huge shout out to the whole shark tank team for taking entrepreneurship in India to the next level and making startups a dinner table conversation. Thank you to the sharks for giving in so much of their time to the show and to budding entrepreneurs.

"I am not saying that we should not have facilities like a house, car, and enough money to survive but There are people who are just promoting or glorifying unnecessary things which we don't need but they create unnecessary demand among us and then we buy into influence.Not everyone needs everything that's why we should know and understand the difference between needs and wants Like What we actually need and what is just a desire or unnecessary expense for us.Everyone needs decent money to live a healthy and satisfactory life in the world but sometimes a few people just promote the race of a successful life or a huge wealth collection which is the completely unnecessary desire Any desire comes with pressure and you have to involve with your time and effort but you don't have huge time to waste on any random things Therefore choose the right thing and see what truly matters to youLike decent money with huge time is better than huge money with zero timeIf you are able to earn good money while giving yourself decent time then it is always good because you will have enough time to spend on things such as any hobbies, traveling, exploring the world, networking, meeting with new people, and n number of things.PS - Choose what truly matters to you, ------------Join my telegram channel to get more knowledgeable, insightful, Inspiring, and career-oriented contentGrowth, and learning in one placeLink - https://lnkd.in/gPBycBJD #learning #education #india #culture"
"Micro-Manage is Micro-Damage to the Culture. Dynamic and Agile leader should never Micro-manage.Recent article in TOI suggests the same Not micro-managing your team can bring several advantages:1. Employee Empowerment: By avoiding micro-management, you allow your team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions. This promotes a sense of empowerment, boosts their confidence, and encourages creativity and innovation.2. Improved Productivity: When employees have autonomy and the freedom to work in their own style, they can utilize their skills and expertise more effectively. This often leads to increased productivity as they can focus on their work without unnecessary interruptions or rigid controls.3. Enhanced Morale and Engagement: Trusting your team to handle their tasks without constant supervision fosters a positive work environment. It shows that you value their abilities and trust them to deliver results. This can improve employee morale, job satisfaction, and overall engagement.4. Professional Growth: Micromanagement can stifle professional growth as it limits employees' opportunities to learn and develop new skills. Allowing individuals to take on challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them promotes continuous learning and personal growth within the team.5. Time Management: By refraining from excessive monitoring, you can allocate your time more effectively. Rather than focusing on minute details, you can concentrate on strategic planning, building relationships, and addressing larger organizational goals.6. Collaboration and Teamwork: A non-micromanaging approach encourages collaboration and teamwork. When employees have the freedom to communicate, share ideas, and contribute to the decision-making process, it strengthens the overall dynamics of the team and promotes a culture of collaboration.7. Retention and Recruitment: A supportive work environment with less micro-management tends to attract and retain talented employees. Professionals seek autonomy, trust, and opportunities for growth. By offering these qualities, you can build a strong team and reduce turnover.Remember, effective leadership involves providing guidance, setting clear expectations, and being available for support when needed, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to thrive."
"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"“We’re letting you go. The job requirements have changed.” My heart sank as I hung up the phone from my line manager.I’ll never forget that heavy feeling. I was always warned how cut-throat corporate America can be; finding out for myself was a valuable life lesson.

"Wow, one month ago I made a post about how exciting it was to be growing my Deal Desk team at Route.  Now, today I join the multitude of doleful posts as being part of the SECOND round of Route layoffs.  Not going to lie, this comes as a huge surprise to me as I have worked hard to establish meaningful relationships with leaders and build from scratch solid Deal Desk processes for our Revenue Org over the past year.  But, just goes to show no position is completely bulletproof.  I express gratitude to the many great Rev Leaders, AEs, and CSMs I got to work with throughout my time at Route.  I also want to thank Jennifer Baumgartner for being a supportive and highly motivating manager.  To my network, please let me know if you hear of any companies in need of a seasoned (and incredibly patient) Deal Desk leader! 🤘🏻#route #layoffs #dealdesk #revops"

"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control! Ask yourself, what am I so attached to that causes me on-going suffering & see if you can do the work to release it!!! If we do not learn how to connect the dots properly, we suffer from disconnect & that disconnect does not serve us...

"As the Menace of Layoffs is continuing and we are hearing about so many of our friends and peers loosing their jobs. I am of the opinion that more than the layoffs, it is untimely and unexpected ask by the organisation to leave when we are completely dependent on it without any backup or preparedness. Unfortunately in the last one week, I have received so many calls from the known and unknown sharing the bitter truth of them getting laid-off, looking for opportunities or an ideal to-do list to find a job. I am a firm believer that continuous efforts and constant learning in our careers will help us in the long term to become resilient.In the light of these developments, I would like to jot down few steps that have helped me and few of my other friends for a career transition or finding an ideal job or a new job search :1) Planning your career and Priorities well in advance : It is always important to have a long term plan of your career, understanding your top priorities in choosing a career and having a mental plan of how you look at your career for a decade or more will help in showing you way forward and taking the right next step in the direction2) CV That reflects and Speaks for you : CV is the first key to the door of opportunities. Invest time and efforts, if needed take help in making a CV that truly reflects your skills, expertise and achievements. It should be able to capture the attention of both the smartness of the systems and eye of the employer3) Constant Learning & Development : There are abundance of platforms that help working professionals to upgrade their knowledge by learning and developing in their core domain or interested areas to increase their credibility as a professional. 2 Hours of Learning every week can make your more resilient. Short term courses and Certifications do help and keep you above others.4) Network is Power : Great Network is always half work done. Investing time in growing your network, reaching out to the right people can help you to find your dream job even faster. A good network also helps in exchange of great knowledge and ideas.5) Finding a Job is a Process : It is not a luck or a by chance thing. Finding a job is a process and it will have its ups and down but surely learning all the way. Thus, one has to believe in the process, learn from it, be persistent and hopeful.6)Having a Mentor : Sometimes all it takes is a right conversation, little guidance or a small advise to boost your confidence and help you during low times. Thus having a good mentor is always like having a cheat code in a tough game. I Would be privileged if I can be of any help to anyone in their careers and always welcome everyone to learn, unite and grow together.I would love to hear from others if there is anything else that can help our friends in finding a new job or in building a resilient career during these testing times.#JobSearch #CareerAdvice #ProfessionalNetworking #layoffs #learning #people"
"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"🌍✈️ Embrace the Journey: Travel - A Gateway to Personal and Professional Growth! ✈️🌍Greetings, LinkedIn fam! Today, I want to celebrate the incredible power of travel and its profound impact on personal and professional growth. Whether you're a seasoned globetrotter or an aspiring adventurer, there's no denying that travel holds the key to unlocking a world of opportunities and experiences.1️⃣ Broadened Horizons: When we step out of our comfort zones and immerse ourselves in different cultures, landscapes, and perspectives, we open our minds to a whole new world of possibilities. Travel introduces us to diverse ways of life, customs, and traditions, fostering empathy and understanding that transcend borders.2️⃣ Adaptability and Resilience: From navigating unfamiliar streets to communicating in foreign languages, every journey presents unique challenges that require adaptability and resilience. Traveling forces us to think on our feet, problem-solve, and embrace unexpected situations with grace.3️⃣ Networking and Collaboration: Travel offers a myriad of opportunities to connect with people from different backgrounds and industries. Whether it's striking up a conversation with fellow travelers at a hostel or attending international conferences and events, these interactions can lead to valuable connections and collaborations. Who knows? Your next career breakthrough or innovative partnership might just be a flight away!4️⃣ Creativity and Inspiration: Exposing ourselves to new landscapes, architectures, art, and cultures can ignite our creativity and fuel our inspiration. The sights, sounds, and experiences we encounter during our travels can spark fresh ideas, enhance problem-solving skills, and provide a wellspring of inspiration for professional endeavors. So, pack your bags and let your imagination soar!5️⃣ Self-Discovery and Personal Growth: Travel often takes us out of our comfort zones and allows us to discover hidden facets of ourselves. It challenges us to face fears, push boundaries, and embrace personal growth. Whether it's conquering a hiking trail, trying local delicacies, or simply navigating through unfamiliar territory, each adventure becomes an opportunity for self-discovery and self-confidence.As we slowly emerge from a challenging period in history, let's remember the transformative power of travel. Whether it's exploring your own backyard or embarking on a cross-continental expedition, let curiosity be your compass and embrace the lessons that travel has to offer.🗺️ So, let's connect and share our travel stories, insights, and aspirations.

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"“We’re letting you go. The job requirements have changed.” My heart sank as I hung up the phone from my line manager.I’ll never forget that heavy feeling. I was always warned how cut-throat corporate America can be; finding out for myself was a valuable life lesson. I live by the mantra:Stay ready; so you don’t have to get ready.So I’d already started building my brand with solid relationships in place. Because jobs aren’t for life but your personal brand is. Still, the experience was emotionally draining.I wish I had more support back then.

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain – this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either. Those two and a half weeks of labor would be my last in the agricultural realm. I wasn't ready for content work yet, but I was one step closer.❦ Let me know if you are looking for a UX/Content Design Leader, as I'm #opentowork! #layoffs #uxwriter #contentdesign #productdesign #UXdesign #contentstrategy ❦"
"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control! Ask yourself, what am I so attached to that causes me on-going suffering & see if you can do the work to release it!!! If we do not learn how to connect the dots properly, we suffer from disconnect & that disconnect does not serve us...

"#Employees #leaving a #job solely due to financial reasons is a common misconception.

It involves recognizing employees' contributions, providing meaningful #feedback, and offering #opportunities for #growth and #development. When #employees feel that their efforts are acknowledged and their #skills are utilized effectively, they are more likely to remain engaged and committed to their work. On the other hand, when employees feel consistently overlooked or their achievements go unnoticed, they may start to question their worth within the organization and explore other options.#Creating a #positive work #culture that fosters appreciation and recognition can be instrumental in retaining talented employees. This involves fostering open #communication channels, providing regular feedback, and creating #opportunities for employees to showcase their skills and talents.

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"
"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"🌐 Exciting Development Alert: Elon Musk Indicates ""Significant Investment"" by Tesla in India! 🚀🇮🇳I'm thrilled to share some remarkable news emerging from Tesla's CEO Elon Musk's meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the United States. Musk revealed that PM Modi has been actively encouraging Tesla to make a ""significant investment"" in India, and he anticipates an official announcement in the near future.The meeting follows previous reports that Musk would brief PM Modi on Tesla's plans to establish a manufacturing base in India. India holds immense potential for a sustainable energy future, with opportunities spanning solar power, stationary battery packs, and electric vehicles. Musk expressed his aspiration to bring SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service to India as well.Musk acknowledged PM Modi's strong commitment to India, stating, ""He really cares about India because he's pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do.""He also expressed confidence in Tesla's future presence in India, affirming their commitment to enter the Indian market as soon as possible.In response to the meeting, India's foreign ministry spokesperson tweeted that PM Modi had invited Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the rapidly expanding commercial space sector in India.India's progressive stance toward its space sector includes plans to allow collaboration between U.S. companies and Indian firms for investments, with the goal of significantly increasing their share of the global launch market in the coming decade. This presents an exciting opportunity for both Tesla and India's thriving space industry.Last month, Tesla executives engaged in productive discussions with Indian officials regarding the establishment of manufacturing facilities for cars and batteries in India. Musk shared that Tesla is expected to finalize a location for a new factory by the end of this year, highlighting India's appeal as a potential destination.With a growing emphasis on diversifying manufacturing bases and reducing reliance on China, U.S. companies are actively exploring opportunities in new markets. Tesla's interest in India aligns with this strategy, despite previous hurdles due to high import tax structures.This development comes amidst recent controversy surrounding Twitter, in which its co-founder accused India of threatening to shut down the platform for non-compliance with content takedown orders during protests.Musk, who owns Twitter, emphasized that platforms like Twitter must adhere to local government laws to avoid shutdowns, shedding light on the complexities of navigating global regulations.Stay tuned for further updates on Tesla's investment plans in India!Follow Herschelle Saldanha for more content on robotics and automation!#tesla #businessautomation #india #automation #robotics"
"As the Menace of Layoffs is continuing and we are hearing about so many of our friends and peers loosing their jobs. I am of the opinion that more than the layoffs, it is untimely and unexpected ask by the organisation to leave when we are completely dependent on it without any backup or preparedness. Unfortunately in the last one week, I have received so many calls from the known and unknown sharing the bitter truth of them getting laid-off, looking for opportunities or an ideal to-do list to find a job. I am a firm believer that continuous efforts and constant learning in our careers will help us in the long term to become resilient.In the light of these developments, I would like to jot down few steps that have helped me and few of my other friends for a career transition or finding an ideal job or a new job search :1) Planning your career and Priorities well in advance : It is always important to have a long term plan of your career, understanding your top priorities in choosing a career and having a mental plan of how you look at your career for a decade or more will help in showing you way forward and taking the right next step in the direction2) CV That reflects and Speaks for you : CV is the first key to the door of opportunities. Invest time and efforts, if needed take help in making a CV that truly reflects your skills, expertise and achievements. It should be able to capture the attention of both the smartness of the systems and eye of the employer3) Constant Learning & Development : There are abundance of platforms that help working professionals to upgrade their knowledge by learning and developing in their core domain or interested areas to increase their credibility as a professional. 2 Hours of Learning every week can make your more resilient. Short term courses and Certifications do help and keep you above others.4) Network is Power : Great Network is always half work done. Investing time in growing your network, reaching out to the right people can help you to find your dream job even faster. A good network also helps in exchange of great knowledge and ideas.5) Finding a Job is a Process : It is not a luck or a by chance thing. Finding a job is a process and it will have its ups and down but surely learning all the way. Thus, one has to believe in the process, learn from it, be persistent and hopeful.6)Having a Mentor : Sometimes all it takes is a right conversation, little guidance or a small advise to boost your confidence and help you during low times. Thus having a good mentor is always like having a cheat code in a tough game. I Would be privileged if I can be of any help to anyone in their careers and always welcome everyone to learn, unite and grow together.I would love to hear from others if there is anything else that can help our friends in finding a new job or in building a resilient career during these testing times.#JobSearch #CareerAdvice #ProfessionalNetworking #layoffs #learning #people"
"“Life’s a mystery going forward, but a science looking back” 🔬 This quote is from Lex Fridman’s podcast with Matthew McConaughey, and it reminded me of the fact that life’s experiences are meant to be learned from but not every step forward needs to be 100% fleshed out. Often the organic is what brings the most fulfillment and purpose when looking back 🤔 So, I decided to reflect on the last four weeks interning at YouTube  (and Google)  Week 1: It’s often the mundane tasks/details that can delay progress at the end of the day so always give 100% of yourself no matter the task/circumstance 💯 Week 2: Life is a revolving door, once you feel you have everything figured out a new challenge arises, and the door continues around and around and around 🚪 Week 3: No matter where you work/what industry you work in, one of the best ways to learn is by talking to those around you who have/or are doing what you want to do. Plus whom doesn’t enjoy a good coffee chat ⁉️ Week 4: Take a step back and pat yourself on the back (yeah you, literally). It’s easy to overlook the fact that you’re doing a great job so always remember those around you shouldn’t be the only ones to recognize that 👍🏽 Also, much gratitude to Kayla Privitelli, Justin Pham and Zuri Godfrey for aiding in making this experience so joyful, insightful, and inspiring! #googleintern #noogler #lifeatgoogle"

"Mind-blowing SQL Notes + 👇10 commonly asked SQL interview questions that you can help you to get into Job 👨‍💻1. What is SQL?SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.2. What are the different types of SQL statements?SQL statements can be broadly classified into three categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).3. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?SQL databases are structured and use a tabular format to store data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph.4. What is a primary key in SQL?A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures data integrity and enables efficient data retrieval.5. What is a foreign key?A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes relationships between tables and enforces referential integrity.6. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates, while UNION ALL combines the result sets without removing duplicates.7. What are SQL joins?Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.8. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before grouping in a query, while the HAVING clause is used to filter groups of rows after grouping in a query.9. What is normalization in SQL?Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them.10. How can you prevent SQL injection attacks?To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to use parameterized queries or prepared statements, properly validate and sanitize user input, and limit the privileges of database users.📍𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗠  𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐉𝐨𝐛, 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 & 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 📒  📚 :- https://lnkd.in/dUiGpNHyFollow R J Goswami  For More 🔺#sql #sqldeveloper #sqlnotes"

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"

"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"
"“We’re letting you go. The job requirements have changed.” My heart sank as I hung up the phone from my line manager.I’ll never forget that heavy feeling. I was always warned how cut-throat corporate America can be; finding out for myself was a valuable life lesson. I live by the mantra:Stay ready; so you don’t have to get ready.So I’d already started building my brand with solid relationships in place. Because jobs aren’t for life but your personal brand is. Still, the experience was emotionally draining.I wish I had more support back then.

"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control! Ask yourself, what am I so attached to that causes me on-going suffering & see if you can do the work to release it!!! If we do not learn how to connect the dots properly, we suffer from disconnect & that disconnect does not serve us...

"🌍✈️ Embrace the Journey: Travel - A Gateway to Personal and Professional Growth! ✈️🌍Greetings, LinkedIn fam! Today, I want to celebrate the incredible power of travel and its profound impact on personal and professional growth. Whether you're a seasoned globetrotter or an aspiring adventurer, there's no denying that travel holds the key to unlocking a world of opportunities and experiences.1️⃣ Broadened Horizons: When we step out of our comfort zones and immerse ourselves in different cultures, landscapes, and perspectives, we open our minds to a whole new world of possibilities. Travel introduces us to diverse ways of life, customs, and traditions, fostering empathy and understanding that transcend borders.2️⃣ Adaptability and Resilience: From navigating unfamiliar streets to communicating in foreign languages, every journey presents unique challenges that require adaptability and resilience. Traveling forces us to think on our feet, problem-solve, and embrace unexpected situations with grace.3️⃣ Networking and Collaboration: Travel offers a myriad of opportunities to connect with people from different backgrounds and industries. Whether it's striking up a conversation with fellow travelers at a hostel or attending international conferences and events, these interactions can lead to valuable connections and collaborations. Who knows? Your next career breakthrough or innovative partnership might just be a flight away!4️⃣ Creativity and Inspiration: Exposing ourselves to new landscapes, architectures, art, and cultures can ignite our creativity and fuel our inspiration. The sights, sounds, and experiences we encounter during our travels can spark fresh ideas, enhance problem-solving skills, and provide a wellspring of inspiration for professional endeavors. So, pack your bags and let your imagination soar!5️⃣ Self-Discovery and Personal Growth: Travel often takes us out of our comfort zones and allows us to discover hidden facets of ourselves. It challenges us to face fears, push boundaries, and embrace personal growth. Whether it's conquering a hiking trail, trying local delicacies, or simply navigating through unfamiliar territory, each adventure becomes an opportunity for self-discovery and self-confidence.As we slowly emerge from a challenging period in history, let's remember the transformative power of travel. Whether it's exploring your own backyard or embarking on a cross-continental expedition, let curiosity be your compass and embrace the lessons that travel has to offer.🗺️ So, let's connect and share our travel stories, insights, and aspirations. Together, we can inspire and empower one another to embark on transformative journeys that shape not only our careers but also our lives.✈️🌍 Let's seize the world, one adventure at a time! 🌍✈️Thank you Aakanksha Monga for inspiring me and the world. 🌻#TravelTales #PersonalGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment #Networking #Inspiration #GlobalMindset"

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain – this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either.

"Back to back interviews.Not a single candidate was meeting the expectations of the jury. Everyone seemed underconfident and nervous. Those who were confident didn't have the skills and practical knowledge. We were heading towards the end of the hiring session.Then a guy entered, he was a fresher and seemed very confident from his body language.As the interview went on, he performed really well.Me : ""How did you prepare yourself for the interview?""Candidate : ""I used to do mock interviews with other candidates.""I was very impressed with this habit of the candidate. Mock interview sessions really help the candidate to develop confidence and good answering skills.He was hired !Whenever you are preparing for an interview always try to practice the probable questions and participate in mock interviews. It will really help you to boost your confidence.#hiring #hr #help #interview #mock #hired #job #jobopportunity #freshershiring"

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"My Off-Campus Amazon Interview Experience:I applied through a referral from a college senior, which undoubtedly expedited my application process.A few weeks after applying, I received a link to an online assessment test, which took place on the Hackerrank platform. The assessment consisted of two coding questions that were intricately linked to Amazon's day-to-day operations. I was able to tackle the problems using Breadth First Search and priority queues. After a brief period, I received a call informing me that I had successfully passed the online assessment round. Then the onsite rounds were scheduled, which were conducted virtually using Amazon's internal tools. Round-1: The initial round was a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) round. The interviewer began by asking me to introduce myself and shared insights about his team. We then delved into two problem-solving exercises, one involving trees and the other centred around graphs. I confidently presented my solutions and discussed the time and space complexities associated with each approach. Round-2: This round, too, was focused on DSA. I was presented with two problems, for which I provided a greedy solution for the first and a hashmap solution for the second. To ensure clarity, I conducted dry runs on the inputs provided by the interviewer. Once again, we discussed the time and space complexities of both solutions.Round-3: The subsequent round was the Hiring Manager interview. The interviewer reviewed my resume, seeking deeper insights into my background. We engaged in a productive conversation that explored various aspects of my experience. Furthermore, the interviewer presented me with a design question. I provided client-side and server-side solutions.Note: For SDE-1 positions, in most companies including Amazon, design questions are not asked. I communicated it to the HM and he acknowledged it in the interview round itself.Round-4: The final round was the Bar Raiser interview, where I faced two additional DSA problems. I confidently presented my solutions and explained the time and space complexities associated with each one. Towards the end of the interview, the interviewer delved into behavioural questions.Note: The sequence of the Bar Raiser and Hiring Manager rounds may vary in different cases.If you're eager to learn more about interview tips or want to discuss any aspects of my experience, feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or on topmate.io.

"Mind-blowing SQL Notes + 👇10 commonly asked SQL interview questions that you can help you to get into Job 👨‍💻1. What is SQL?SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.2. What are the different types of SQL statements?SQL statements can be broadly classified into three categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).3. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?SQL databases are structured and use a tabular format to store data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph.4. What is a primary key in SQL?A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures data integrity and enables efficient data retrieval.5. What is a foreign key?A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes relationships between tables and enforces referential integrity.6. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates, while UNION ALL combines the result sets without removing duplicates.7. What are SQL joins?Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.8. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before grouping in a query, while the HAVING clause is used to filter groups of rows after grouping in a query.9. What is normalization in SQL?Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them.10. How can you prevent SQL injection attacks?To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to use parameterized queries or prepared statements, properly validate and sanitize user input, and limit the privileges of database users.📍𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗠  𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐉𝐨𝐛, 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 & 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 📒  📚 :- https://lnkd.in/dUiGpNHyFollow R J Goswami  For More 🔺#sql #sqldeveloper #sqlnotes"

"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"

"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"🌐 Exciting Development Alert: Elon Musk Indicates ""Significant Investment"" by Tesla in India! 🚀🇮🇳I'm thrilled to share some remarkable news emerging from Tesla's CEO Elon Musk's meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the United States. Musk revealed that PM Modi has been actively encouraging Tesla to make a ""significant investment"" in India, and he anticipates an official announcement in the near future.The meeting follows previous reports that Musk would brief PM Modi on Tesla's plans to establish a manufacturing base in India. India holds immense potential for a sustainable energy future, with opportunities spanning solar power, stationary battery packs, and electric vehicles. Musk expressed his aspiration to bring SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service to India as well.Musk acknowledged PM Modi's strong commitment to India, stating, ""He really cares about India because he's pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do.""He also expressed confidence in Tesla's future presence in India, affirming their commitment to enter the Indian market as soon as possible.In response to the meeting, India's foreign ministry spokesperson tweeted that PM Modi had invited Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the rapidly expanding commercial space sector in India.India's progressive stance toward its space sector includes plans to allow collaboration between U.S. companies and Indian firms for investments, with the goal of significantly increasing their share of the global launch market in the coming decade. This presents an exciting opportunity for both Tesla and India's thriving space industry.Last month, Tesla executives engaged in productive discussions with Indian officials regarding the establishment of manufacturing facilities for cars and batteries in India. Musk shared that Tesla is expected to finalize a location for a new factory by the end of this year, highlighting India's appeal as a potential destination.With a growing emphasis on diversifying manufacturing bases and reducing reliance on China, U.S. companies are actively exploring opportunities in new markets. Tesla's interest in India aligns with this strategy, despite previous hurdles due to high import tax structures.This development comes amidst recent controversy surrounding Twitter, in which its co-founder accused India of threatening to shut down the platform for non-compliance with content takedown orders during protests.Musk, who owns Twitter, emphasized that platforms like Twitter must adhere to local government laws to avoid shutdowns, shedding light on the complexities of navigating global regulations.Stay tuned for further updates on Tesla's investment plans in India!Follow Herschelle Saldanha for more content on robotics and automation!#tesla #businessautomation #india #automation #robotics"

"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control!

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain – this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either. Those two and a half weeks of labor would be my last in the agricultural realm. I wasn't ready for content work yet, but I was one step closer.❦ Let me know if you are looking for a UX/Content Design Leader, as I'm #opentowork! #layoffs #uxwriter #contentdesign #productdesign #UXdesign #contentstrategy ❦"

"Greetings Connections,I am excited to share that I have successfully completed my two-month internship at Cipla! This experience has been truly enriching, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work here.One of the things that I appreciated most about Cipla was the company culture. Cipla is truly committed to its motto of ""Caring for Life,"" and this is evident in everything that the company does. From the way that employees are treated to the way that products are developed.During my internship, I had the opportunity to visit the Cipla manufacturing plant and the Cipla Palliative Care, and I was inspired by the work that they do to provide care to patients.I would like to extend my thanks to Shilpa Nambiar and Ranju Nambiar for managing the entire internship program seamlessly.Overall, my two-month internship at Cipla was an invaluable experience.I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a great company, and I am excited to see what the future holds."

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"
"Mind-blowing SQL Notes + 👇10 commonly asked SQL interview questions that you can help you to get into Job 👨‍💻1. What is SQL?SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.2. What are the different types of SQL statements?SQL statements can be broadly classified into three categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).3. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?SQL databases are structured and use a tabular format to store data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph.4. What is a primary key in SQL?A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures data integrity and enables efficient data retrieval.5. What is a foreign key?A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes relationships between tables and enforces referential integrity.6. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates, while UNION ALL combines the result sets without removing duplicates.7. What are SQL joins?Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.8. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before grouping in a query, while the HAVING clause is used to filter groups of rows after grouping in a query.9. What is normalization in SQL?Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them.10. How can you prevent SQL injection attacks?To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to use parameterized queries or prepared statements, properly validate and sanitize user input, and limit the privileges of database users.📍𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗠  𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐉𝐨𝐛, 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 & 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 📒  📚 :- https://lnkd.in/dUiGpNHyFollow R J Goswami  For More 🔺#sql #sqldeveloper #sqlnotes"
"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don’t show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don’t just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. “Product Manager”, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we’re the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself. Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"
"🌐 Exciting Development Alert: Elon Musk Indicates ""Significant Investment"" by Tesla in India! 🚀🇮🇳I'm thrilled to share some remarkable news emerging from Tesla's CEO Elon Musk's meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the United States. Musk revealed that PM Modi has been actively encouraging Tesla to make a ""significant investment"" in India, and he anticipates an official announcement in the near future.The meeting follows previous reports that Musk would brief PM Modi on Tesla's plans to establish a manufacturing base in India. India holds immense potential for a sustainable energy future, with opportunities spanning solar power, stationary battery packs, and electric vehicles. Musk expressed his aspiration to bring SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service to India as well.Musk acknowledged PM Modi's strong commitment to India, stating, ""He really cares about India because he's pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do.""He also expressed confidence in Tesla's future presence in India, affirming their commitment to enter the Indian market as soon as possible.In response to the meeting, India's foreign ministry spokesperson tweeted that PM Modi had invited Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the rapidly expanding commercial space sector in India.India's progressive stance toward its space sector includes plans to allow collaboration between U.S. companies and Indian firms for investments, with the goal of significantly increasing their share of the global launch market in the coming decade. This presents an exciting opportunity for both Tesla and India's thriving space industry.Last month, Tesla executives engaged in productive discussions with Indian officials regarding the establishment of manufacturing facilities for cars and batteries in India. Musk shared that Tesla is expected to finalize a location for a new factory by the end of this year, highlighting India's appeal as a potential destination.With a growing emphasis on diversifying manufacturing bases and reducing reliance on China, U.S. companies are actively exploring opportunities in new markets. Tesla's interest in India aligns with this strategy, despite previous hurdles due to high import tax structures.This development comes amidst recent controversy surrounding Twitter, in which its co-founder accused India of threatening to shut down the platform for non-compliance with content takedown orders during protests.Musk, who owns Twitter, emphasized that platforms like Twitter must adhere to local government laws to avoid shutdowns, shedding light on the complexities of navigating global regulations.Stay tuned for further updates on Tesla's investment plans in India!Follow Herschelle Saldanha for more content on robotics and automation!#tesla #businessautomation #india #automation #robotics"

"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"People confuse non-attachment with some renunciation & withdrawal from Life! The image conjured up is one where people head off to some caves donning saffron robes, chanting with beads in hand & ashes smeared on the forehead! It is anything but... Instead, it's a process where we come to terms with the Reality of Impermanence & seek to cling less tightly to everything! We try to figure out a path where we remain connected yet aware of the limitations of the system! When you no longer seek to find yourself in something, the detachment drops off in what seems natural as opposed to the struggle to let go!For me, this is better preparedness for the unexpected! When one is less set on a specific outcome, then you are in a much better place in handling whatever the outcome is! The ones who give up trying to control the uncontrollables have an edge as they are not fighting battles that cannot be won & can spend their time and energy on the movable parts! They have an Acceptance & a Surrender mindset and are able to handle and cope with Life's surprises! 🗝️ By having less attachment, one is able to go with the flow! 🗝️ It means that however things unravel, I will be OK! 🗝️ My being OK is not attached to some specific outcomes beyond my control! Ask yourself, what am I so attached to that causes me on-going suffering & see if you can do the work to release it!!! If we do not learn how to connect the dots properly, we suffer from disconnect & that disconnect does not serve us...

This experience has been truly enriching, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work here.One of the things that I appreciated most about Cipla was the company culture. Cipla is truly committed to its motto of ""Caring for Life,"" and this is evident in everything that the company does. From the way that employees are treated to the way that products are developed.During my internship, I had the opportunity to visit the Cipla manufacturing plant and the Cipla Palliative Care, and I was inspired by the work that they do to provide care to patients.I would like to extend my thanks to Shilpa Nambiar and Ranju Nambiar for managing the entire internship program seamlessly.Overall, my two-month internship at Cipla was an invaluable experience.I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a great company, and I am excited to see what the future holds."

"Google new AI algorithm predicts heart disease from a simple eye scan.Goodbye to CT Scans, MRIs, Xrays. Presented by Google's CEO Sundar Pichai.Scientists from Google and its health-tech subsidiary Verily have discovered a new way to assess a person’s risk of heart disease using machine learning. -By analyzing scans of the back of a patient’s eye, the company’s software is able to accurately deduce data, including an individual’s age, blood pressure, and whether or not they smoke. This can then be used to predict their risk of suffering a major cardiac event — such as a heart attack — with roughly the same accuracy as current leading methods.The algorithm potentially makes it quicker and easier for doctors to analyze a patient’s cardiovascular risk, as it doesn’t require a blood test.To train the algorithm, Google and Verily’s scientists used machine learning to analyze a medical dataset of nearly 300,000 patients. This information included eye scans as well as general medical data. As with all deep learning analysis, neural networks were then used to mine this information for patterns, learning to associate telltale signs in the eye scans with the metrics needed to predict cardiovascular risk#ai #data #machinelearning #deeplearning #neuralnetworks #learning #health #tech #event #software #google #medical #doctors #artificialintelligence #algorithms #algorithm #ml #iot"

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain – this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either. Those two and a half weeks of labor would be my last in the agricultural realm. I wasn't ready for content work yet, but I was one step closer.❦ Let me know if you are looking for a UX/Content Design Leader, as I'm #opentowork! #layoffs #uxwriter #contentdesign #productdesign #UXdesign #contentstrategy ❦"

"Mind your Mind “Don’t let others ruin your happiness”, one of my friends told me while referring to the constant politics at the office. Most of the times political correctness is important to succeed than mere performance. That’s a fact. At times we take the office scene way too seriously. The value of earning a livelihood most of the times is overestimated. Probably, it’s the attachment to our posts and positions which doesn’t allow us to see ourselves out of the office setting.I too like many other professionals struggle with this challenge. The only good thing is I have started to notice it more often than before. I can’t stop the mind from thinking but what definitely I can control is the focus of my thinking 🧐 The epic text Bhagavad Gita explains मन्मना भव मद्भ‍क्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ॥ Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.(9.34)So the key is the ‘engagement/focus of the mind’. By shifting our focus we will able to free our mind and ourselves from the artificial shackles which is binding us. When you change your focus your goals and attachments automatically change. Here’s what can help us from coming out of that vicious circle ⭕️ 1. Mantra Meditation relaxes the mind like anything. It’s kind of reset the whole system. Do it for 10 mins to begin with everyday 🧘‍♂️ 2. Make a list of 10 things which your profession can’t provide you. You will be shocked to see the list has the most important things of our life. 3. Improve your engagement level at places other than office - home, social centre, gym, temple etc. Open up more avenues for your mind. 4. Last but not the least - READ BOOKS regularly. It stimulates the deep inherent power of the mind like anything. Don’t stop thinking 🤔 or try to become thoughtless you can’t do that, just shift the focus of your thoughts. #corporatemythology #mindfulness #leadershipsutras"

"I feel sympathy for the 22,500 employees of Credit Suisse who are about to lose their jobs https://lnkd.in/gS575ai9.  Some of them have no doubt lost a significant portion of their savings also, due to 401k plan investments, deferred compensation, etc.  At one time, Credit Suisse was a world-class firm, highly regarded by competitors and customers alike.  And in different ways, this will be a painful, awful experience for all CS former employees living through this transition, just as it was for the thousands of people (myself included) who lost their jobs when Bear Stearns hit the wall in 2008.  Nobody likes losing their job, but when a firm collapses in ignominious fashion, it is especially difficult.  As with the Bear collapse and the Lehman bankruptcy, reputations have been damaged.  But you are not your firm, and you are not your firm's incompetent management (unless you are, in fact, the management, in which case you should be ashamed of yourselves).   Wall Street is great at creative destruction, so if you work hard, remain modest, and focus on your customers, you will be able to rebuild your career.   #creditsuisse #ubs #layoffs #wallstreet #transitions"

"My recent interview experience at Adobe →I got to know about the hiring from the LinkedIn job section and asked for a referral from one of the Adobe employees.I received a call from HR and got the first interview scheduled for the next day.🔹 The first round was a technical round.It started with the skills mentioned on my resume and after that, I was asked a coding question which has been previously asked in Adobe, the question was the maximum diameter of a binary tree.First, I explained the approach, did a dry run, and then coded the same. Next again I was asked questions on my projects and this way the round went quite well within an hour.🔹 The second round was again a technical round.I was asked to code on clone of the linked list and was told to do some modifications. Next again I was asked about my projects. This round too went quite well for an hour.🔹 The third round with the director.In this round, I was supposed to be asked HLD as HR had already conveyed the same before, and alas I wasn't prepared for that, so I wasn't able to proceed.Though I wasn't prepared and missed grabbing the opportunity, I will learn from this experience.One thing that helps in clearing these rounds is doing structured preparation and giving regular mock interviews. I am a self learner, but it’s not true for everyone. So if you need help in doing structred preparation, I’ll suggest you take help from veterans at Bosscoder Academy. I’ll recommend you prepare with their help here - https://rb.gy/8zls0 They can help you with →✅ Structured program to learn problem solving in DSA, System Design and Full Stack Development✅ Personal mentorship from industry experts from Amazon, Microsoft, Arcesium and Google✅ Live classes and 24x7 doubt support along with access to a talented community of software engineers with similar goal of upskillingOnce they help you upskill, they’ll provide you with dedicated placement support as well.#dsa #tech #systemdesign #prep #coding #interview #job #projects #design #experience"

"📝Taking stand for others is an act of social responsibility and selflessness 🎯Some lessons to derive from this post:➡️Bryan Stevenson once said, ""We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.""➡️Most people don't usually take stand for others because they think 💬 ✔️It's none of their business✔️ It's not going to benefit them in any way. ✔️ It might get them in trouble ( they don't want to share the blame, burden or take responsibility for others )✔️Lack of empathy and critical thinking ( Empathy is a skill that has to be developed by making a conscious effort)➡️If not corrected, such kind of attitude will get us in trouble sooner or later in life because when we will be in need of assistance, we are less likely to receive help from others too. ➡️There are five main principles of social justice that are paramount to understanding the concept: Namely, 1)Access to resources, 2) Equity, 3) Participation, 4) Diversity, and 5) Human rights.Write-Up: Jandeep Singh  #communalresponsibility #injustice #people"

"Hey all, guess it's my turn to post..You probably haven't seen a post from me in a long time (if ever), I mostly use LinkedIn as a tool to learn from my networks and other professionals in my space.Unfortunately, after over 3 years at Route, the entire enablement department has been cut.I wanted to take a few days to reflect on my time at Route before posting. Route was a company where I was constantly challenged and was constantly learning. It's somewhere I made lifelong friends and grew tremendously, both professionally and personally. I was caught off guard and disappointed by this news, but over all, I am very thankful for my time at Route.I also want to take a moment to thank Jessika Ward and David Rogers for being two of the best leaders I've ever worked with. I've learned so much from you both and will miss working together. It's a small world and I'm sure we'll cross paths again.With that being said, I am now open for work! While I started out my career as an AE, I've leveraged that expertise into a Sales Enablement and Operations focus. I have in-depth experience creating and managing onboarding programs, creating long term training programs, change management, sales processes, etc.I'm open to roles in Revenue Enablement and Operations, and hope you'll all keep me in mind for any new opportunities that come up.Thank you all for your support and thank you to all my friends at Route, it's time to find my next adventure!#layoffs #salesenablement #salesoperations #techlayoffs #layoffs2023"
"Google new AI algorithm predicts heart disease from a simple eye scan.Goodbye to CT Scans, MRIs, Xrays. Presented by Google's CEO Sundar Pichai.Scientists from Google and its health-tech subsidiary Verily have discovered a new way to assess a person’s risk of heart disease using machine learning. -By analyzing scans of the back of a patient’s eye, the company’s software is able to accurately deduce data, including an individual’s age, blood pressure, and whether or not they smoke. This can then be used to predict their risk of suffering a major cardiac event — such as a heart attack — with roughly the same accuracy as current leading methods.The algorithm potentially makes it quicker and easier for doctors to analyze a patient’s cardiovascular risk, as it doesn’t require a blood test.To train the algorithm, Google and Verily’s scientists used machine learning to analyze a medical dataset of nearly 300,000 patients. This information included eye scans as well as general medical data. As with all deep learning analysis, neural networks were then used to mine this information for patterns, learning to associate telltale signs in the eye scans with the metrics needed to predict cardiovascular risk#ai #data #machinelearning #deeplearning #neuralnetworks #learning #health #tech #event #software #google #medical #doctors #artificialintelligence #algorithms #algorithm #ml #iot"
"I know how it feels :’( But DP is not some topic that can’t be mastered, want a structured plan to learn it?
