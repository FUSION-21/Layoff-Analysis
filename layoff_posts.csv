"Why is it important for journalists to talk to people? In a rush to file stories, a lot of us miss an important aspect of our stories. People. A few days ago, while covering layoffs, I spoke to a few BYJU's employees who were just laid off. They opened up a lot and that's when one of them asked me ""you know that they haven't been paying our PF money, right?"" I rushed to my bosses with this info, who in turn wanted me to cross-check this. A few sources confirmed this and by evening, I had payslips and PF statements. I ended up talking to more people over the weekend and it literally opened a can of worms. And that was when the idea of checking the EPFO data came up (Thanks to a risk specialist friend and the Hindu Group HR for helping out here)! And that was it. Everything pointed towards the same thing!This is the story here, which we got to know, just because someone shared their story, the old-school way. A businessline exclusive"

"Whats happening with Byju's? The following pointers capture the series of events:1. July 2022 : ToppR, White-hat junior: both laid off 500 employees2. Sept 2022 : Filed FY 21 earnings : 18 month delayed (supposed to be filed 6 months)3. The FY 21 financials showed 4500 Cr Losses (13X higher loss YoY) 4. Nov 2022 : Valuation cut internally from $22 Billion to $11 Billion5. 1.2 Billion dollars of debt was raised to ensure completion of acquisition of Aakash. However Byju's sued the lenders claiming 'acceleration of the borrowing' and also seeked disqualification of Redwood, the Key lender. 6. Feb 2023: Byjus layoffs approx 1500 employees7. April 2023: major NBFCs suspended lending to Byju's customers. This is massive as a huge number of Byju's users do depend on these loan providers given the offering range of 20k to 140k Rs8. June 2023: Deloitte resigns from the position of Byju's statutory auditor raising concerns on delay in FY 22 filing9. June 2023: 3 board of directors resigned *Before we sensationalise this series of events and talk about the one big bad , lets go deeper into the #macroeconomics changes that have happened at the same time: - #demand Changes:  Covid years inflated the demand for online education massively. Post Covid era with offline schooling back in place, the ecosystem has changed. The demand naturally has gone down, making current valuations of the company very difficult to defend- #acquisition decisions : White-hat jr 2020, Aakash and Toppr in 2021The acquisition decisions were made in a market which was TopLine focused and with that context, these decisions at that time made sense. The current market is majorly a function of Unit Economics. The market focus change now makes these very questionable decisions - The #domino Effect: Once the NBFCs cut off the lendings, Byju's had to rely on inhouse offering, Byju's Assure , Byju's Advantage and Byju's direct. Given Byju's isn't a expert into lending, this movement is making running the business both very capital intensive as well as very riskyMultiple macro factors have come to cause the sequence of events which is leading to the institute's struggle. In any outlying situation good or bad, it's very easy to romanticise a hero or a villian,  but never is the reality this simple. Both situations take a bunch of environmental factor, a group of people taking right or wrong decisions, a bucket loads of luck, good or bad. Not taking away responsibility, at this time the company needs to come clean on its financials, be realistic about its valuation, develop the omni-channel approach which its already started with Aakash. Best thing for our entire ecosystem is Byju's coming out of this a winner and thats what we should root for!  #business #byjus #events #startup #governance"
"Layoffs are the worst thing when you are going through, but the best thing when you look back.When I got laid off it was the toughest period of my life. I lost both my mom & job at the same time. I did not know where to begin, how to begin, what to do. But I remember I had clarity that I would not waste a minute & regret later.Almost 2 years everything I tried did not work out. But thankfully I had by then started to enjoy the journey. I was not fighting anything or running after anything. It was a good space.As I shifted inside my life started to change outside. I started to think about what truly gives me joy & it was writing. I also wanted to make a difference to people's lives. As I started to write who knew it could help other people in their journey. It was as if the universe had given me a gift which would give me joy & help fulfil my purpose.Life is a setup by the universe the sooner we understand the better. Layoffs are beautiful!What do you think?Register for our career lab workshop at:https://lnkd.in/dsDEzdAz #career #layoffs #jobs"
"Never waste a layoff. Four lessons from my experience.Layoffs in the tech industry have slowed down. But, we are not done yet. Grab, the biggest homegrown name in tech announced sizeable layoffs this week. If you are one who was affected, remember the Persian saying, “this too shall pass”.Here are four lessons I learned from my own layoff experience.First, focus on self care and what really matters, namely health, family and friends. I assume you had to deprioritise at least one of these in the quest to give your best at a fast moving company like Grab. Now is the time to set the balance right, at least a little bit. By focusing on health, family and friends you will gain both energy and joy in multiples. That will set you in the right frame of mind for the upcoming job search.Second, if your financial and immigration status allows, give yourself space and time. I recommend taking a month off where you do not kick off a job search. Take this time to recharge and reflect.I used my post layoff time to reflect on what makes me truly happy, what gives me energy, and what I am curious about. I also reflected on my life’s priorities, and my how I was performing on those priorities. I then put some fixes in place for priorities I had been neglecting. What I reflected on are ideas that may or may not be relevant to you. Pick what you reflect on based on your context & introspection. I have found quiet reflective breaks to be very energising. I hope you do too!Third, focus on the convergence of energy and curiosity. Find at least one activity that gives you energy and you are curious about. It could be anything at all and does not have to be work related. Start doing more of that activity. If possible, start teaching / sharing more about that activity with others. In doing so, you will share energy with others who need it. Be the energy giver!Fourth, avoid getting bogged down by the question, ""why me?"". There is no good answer for it. Large scale layoffs are a spreadsheet exercise. They are not about you or your performance. Getting laid off sucks. It hurts in many ways. But it is also an opportunity. Don’t waste it.All the best, and remember, “this too shall pass”.(Edit: my original post offered a free coaching session to those impacted, but unfortunately I have been overwhelmed with requests. Therefore pausing my offer till I finish helping those who have already reached out)"
"5000+ fired staff’s curses finally begin to blow on BYJU'S!After resignation of Deloitte and 3 key board members in a day, $22 billion BYJU’S now seems busy in launching paid campaigns to cover up all news.Publications like Moneycontrol, The Federal News, and India Today have recently talked about its great work culture!😂But reality is,1. Layoffs: It’s forced 24X7 working juniors to senior leaders like senior managers, VPs, and associate VPs to resign to save ESOPs and salaries.2. Lowered Salaries: Employee salaries declined from Rs 10 Lakh/annum to Rs 7 Lakh to 5 Lakh/annum or lesser.3. Shut down:It's closed its training division and reduced pre-sales department by 90%.Now, several state employee unions are in talks to go to Union Labor Minister against its serious labor law violations.Although I posted last year about the total number of laid-off employees of BYJU’S may cross 12,000 in 2023, few people called me a fraud. Now, it’s coming up!📉Though BYJU’S denied reports of exit of 3 board members:- Sequoia Capital's India arm.-  Prosus.- Chan Zuckerberg.Inc42 Media said they’ve found dissimilarities in operational issues with founder BYJU.For example,- It’s strange when BYJU acquired a 30% stake for Rs 1983 Cr in its biggest subsidiary Aakash. He did it in private as he missed payment deadline to BlackRock and other promoters of Aakash’s deal. - He secured funds from Qatar Investment Authority which provided them with an unofficial stake in Aakash.- Even BYJU himself invested $400 million in parent company Think & Learn in March 2022.It’s a huge issue of complicated payments for 100+ investors as BYJU’S is taking Aakash to IPO in 2024.It seems BYJU was playing snake and ladder with funds and stakes.😂As it’s yet to release its FY22 results which ended on 31st March 2022, it's appointed BDO (MSKA & Associates) as its new auditor.You may see BDO will leave BYJU's in a month or two.On another hand, BYJU’S is already stuck for its $1.2 billion loan repayment and hidden loan of $500 million where it’s facing lawsuits in US. After raising $6 billion in total, BYJU’S now faces a probe from the Ministry Of Corporate Affairs due to corporate governance lapses.PS- With an overflow of funds and a drought of communication, BYJU’S has become a perfect example which will be never followed.Even BYJU'S employees said they've run out of money after raising Rs 2000 Cr a month ago!😅Can BYJU’s survive this storm?Do you think the end of the ed-sales giant is near?Follow #debcreates and Debonkar now for such case studies on startups, brands, and CEOs!🔥 #india #sales #startup #legal #investing #finance"
"The organizations who are laying off left, right and centre right now, are the same organizations who will be looking for stability in a candidate, once they get into hiring spree,again!And the candidate whom they have fired - their stability will be questioned 7-8 months from now.You also have people who feels if a candidate was laid off then candidate would have been non performer. woaaaa i know companies who had laid off 30-50% of employees in the pretence of non performance. well CEO should be fired first if 30% employees are non performers or perhaps the defination of non performance is not well defined.Disappointing fact - the onus of proving stability is only on candidate. If a candidate has hopped multiple times in a year's time or even less then its assumed that it was candidate's fault / candidate is job hopper / candidate is unstable! Thinking and mindset of most of the organizations in today point of time where hashtag of #opentowork has massive taggings. fellas who are facing tough time finding a job - stay strong, this too shall pass! #hiring #mindset #job #layoff #hiringspree #culture #aggressivehiring #startup #startupculture"

"Are you ready for a layoff?In today's world, things are moving very fast. Organizations that were hiring frenetically a few months ago have started downsizing and laying off people. They may even start hiring again in the very near future.Unlike the olden days, today, there is nothing like ""job security"".This volatile business cycle of companies is not just restricted to IT organizations. We have seen selective layoffs arising at even C-Suite levels as a consequence of redundancies due to mergers, demergers, M&As, and corporate restructuring/restrategizing.In the USA, such layoffs are quite common.

"Abruptly, hundreds of Byju's employees got to know last Friday (June 16) that it was their last working day. In addition to this, the impacted employees' email addresses were discontinued and official identity cards were confiscated. And now, a fresh report states that the remaining employees' morale has taken a huge hit amidst the layoffs and employees want to leave the organisation in fear of getting fired overnight.“Morale is at an all-time low. Literally every person has a job portal open on their laptop at all times. Everyone wants to leave desperately before they are asked to pack up overnight,” a senior manager at Byju's said, requesting to be anonymous. The manager further added that the situation right now is that managers and their subordinates are sitting together, looking for new jobs.The laid-off employees will get two months' salary as severance and their full and final settlement should reach them by September-October, or about 45 days after July. After this, no extra severance will be given by the company.Follow for more!#tech #technews #byjus #layoff #update"
"This is what a layoff can lead too. A lot of companies after the start of pandemic has started following this unethical practice of laying off their staff just to earn more profits without considering how much the life of a laid off employee will get affected. Many such posts have come on my LinkedIn feeds where an employee has been laid off 2 or 4 or 6 months back and still he/she has not got a job in the market even after giving hundreds of interviews. They all are battling depression in their personal lives due to the unethical practice of layoffs and over expectations of recruiters while recruiting a new employee. What kind of entrepreneurship mindset we entrepreneurs have! As an entrepreneur we don’t even know how to manage our Human Resource!!Whenever their is a surge in the demand we entrepreneurs start over hiring as most of the edtechs had done during pandemic and then when they realise that it is not resulting in the scale of profit as they have expected they start layoffing their employees. The same employees who had given their day and nights for the vision of company, the same employees had worked had and delivered beyond their job role expectations. Then suddenly one morning a mail appears from the CEO or the owner of the company that you are among the 25% or 50% of the layoff staff. And all this is due to lack of planning, lack of forsightedness, lack of Human Resource management. At the end the employee has to suffer due to all these mismanagement on the part of the companies. Entrepreneurs draft many values and claim their companies to be based on those values and expect that each employee should showcase and imbibe those values.But what about those values when these companies layoff their employees suddenly. I wish such companies must show their own drafted values at the time of layoffs. Atleast talk to your teams, which you always call it a family. Does any family at the time of crisis throws their family members out of the house ? If companies really think that their teams are their families then they should talk to their teams like a family before doing layoff. Tell them the situation of organization and ask them how they can help. Give them some options such as1. Ask them if they can work on reduced salaries until the situation of organization gets better.2. Ask them if they are ok with no promotions or salary hikes until the org starts to stabilise.3. WFH can be one of the options which will reduce the office cost to a great extent, which orgs are paying in crores. Now a days their is no job which can’t be done remotely if proper KPI’s are drafted and a proper reporting system is created. If employees are not open for such options  then the layoffs should be the last option and I am sure most of the employees will be open for these options. Wishing all the best to all who got laid off and are in the search of a new job."
"It is far from being over - the firefight is still going on.According to data, 2023 probably wasn't the year for India's start-up ecosystem, and the layoff season is far from being over.

"We are facing layoffs and  job insecurity issues these days. An Individual living in the fear of getting laidoff or not being able to secure his/her place in the organisation increased lack of sense of belonging, disturbed mind, Inferiority complex these days.Layoffs can indeed have adverse effects on the lives of individuals, particularly those in the middle class. When layoffs occur, it often disrupts the financial stability, well-being, and overall prospects of those affected. Let's consider some adverse effects- * Financial instability: Losing a job can result in an immediate loss of income, creating financial strain for individuals and their families. Middle-class individuals often have certain financial commitments, such as mortgage payments, car loans, and education expenses, which may become challenging to meet without a steady income. This can lead to accumulating debt, difficulty maintaining a standard of living, and even the risk of falling out of the middle class.*Reduced job prospects: During times of layoffs, the job market becomes more competitive as more people are searching for work. This can make it harder for those who have been laid off to find new employment. Individuals may find it difficult to secure a job that matches their previous income and job level, leading to a potential downward shift in their career trajectory.* Emotional and psychological impact: Losing a job can have a significant emotional toll on individuals. It can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, depression and a loss of self-esteem. Individuals may face additional pressures due to their financial obligations, which can further exacerbate these emotional challenges. * Disruption of future plans: Individuals often have long-term plans related to savings, homeownership, education for their children, and other aspirations. Layoffs can result in a loss of progress and opportunities for personal and financial growth.* Health and well-being: Financial stress, job insecurity, and emotional distress resulting from layoffs can have adverse effects on physical and mental health. Increased stress levels can lead to a variety of health problems, including high BP, heart disease, and mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Middle-class individuals may struggle to access healthcare services and support systems during this challenging period.Governments, organizations, and communities should implement measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of layoffs, such as unemployment benefits, job training programs, and support networks.#work #growth #job #future #mentalhealth #help #employment #layoffs #people #competition #opportunities #worklifebalance"
"In 2022, a total of 1,052 tech companies had laid off 1,61,411 employees [ source : layoffs. fyi]The numbers are worse for 2023. 🥺A Layoff is loss of job from factors beyond one’s control. While a Layoff cannot be controlled, one can take charge of their income. Being in charge makes you comfortable during the mentally draining time that starts immediately when a Layoff is announced and continues till you get a job you would like to work for. Having monetary support for 3-4 months of salary can empower you during this situation and help you make the decision that is best for you instead of making a compromise. Last week in the news, I read about Jobsurance .

"Meta recently laid of 21,000 people.  12,000 Google employees - gone.  I think people have a right to be pissed.  But behind the anger, there's a bigger opportunity.  An opportunity to prepare.

It actually helped you become a better version of yourself.✅Highlight the lessons learned: Talk about how the layoff taught you to be proactive and the lessons you have learnt from your mistakes  ✅Talk about your performance: Remember, a layoff is just one part of your journey; it doesn't define your entire career. Take the opportunity to talk about your performance at the previous firm. ✅Bring your Energy: While giving interview stay conscious of your body language and reflect energy and enthusiasm. Were you laid off at your previous job?

"Here's why I would advise recruiters to not hire laid off candidates for a pay cut.The recession has been hard on all of us. A lot of tech jobs were eliminated and many people were laid off most for reasons not related to performance . A good number of my friends were unfortunately part of those layoffs and it was really sad to see them frustrated and depressed for getting back to the job market . Some of my friends searched for months while some got placed in days. Almost all of them  had to take a  pay cut ranging from few lakhs to some as much as 40%. However here's something funny I realized while connecting with them recently. Every single one of them has switched by now to another job that paid them more or equal to when they got laid off. All they did at their intermediate job was leetcode and apply. They never cared about performance at job because they were simply not going to stay there.Not to mention most of them were a nightmare to their managers. Imagine an employee who just doesn't care. Frequently missing standups, not replying to managers , poorly released prs, missing deadlines were just few of the many troubles their managers had to face as a reward for hiring them.Once a person has recieved a significant salary he/she can never be satisfied  for a lower paycheck. Its basic human nature . You don't want ur company to be the rebound for the candidate till he gets a better job. If u have a decent budget like most of those companies did it's much better to hire someone with a lower previous compensation. Trust me a happy dumb employee is going to be deliver more value than a smart unhappy one."
"Were you a part of the recent layoffs ⁉️Well, I have been in the past..The anxiety and uncertainty that comes when you lose your current job is unmatched. The very first day after the news is broken to you is the most difficult one to spend. The future becomes uncertain, and it can be challenging to determine one’s next steps. Fortunately, I received a generous severance package, when I was laid off & it offered some financial stability for a few months. However, not all companies offer the same level of support, and one can never predict when another round of layoffs may occur within an organization.Recently, I came across a platform called Jobsurance  and I was pleasantly surprised by the services they offer.

"Big tech giants have laid off approximately 54,000 employees from Jan to June 2023!To say that tech companies have been affected by the recession would be an understatement.

Rather, to show you the other side of layoffs and help you become recession-proof.Let's consider these facts before losing hope and hearing the layoff news!👉The tech industry is growing despite the recession👉FAAMG companies are still profitable because of their record of innovation and growthNow, here are a few things you need to do to ensure you have a job:✅Network with other tech professionals. Networking is one of the best ways to find a job. Attend industry events, join online forums, and reach out to people you know in tech. A lot of freshers DM with their queries and I try to help as much as I can. If not, I create a post, just like this! 👀✅Keep your skills up to date. This may sound cliche but give at least an hour to learn whatever is happening in the tech industry as it is constantly changing.✅Be flexible. The job market for tech workers is competitive, so you may need to be flexible with your location, salary, or job title.

"𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡-𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚?As layoffs continue to rock the tech world, Indian companies are no exception to the sad trend that has left many in the tech and startup economy jobless. Virtual learning providers - major pandemic winners - have been the hardest hit now that global markets are transitioning away from the pandemic economy. According to the layoff tracking website, layoff.fyi in 2023 have already surpassed the numbers last year. In 2022, 1056 tech companies decided to cut jobs across sectors, impacting nearly 1.64 lakh workers throughout the year. In India, several tech companies have taken harsh measures to cut jobs and save money. The companies include Dunzo, Sharechat, Rebel Foods, BharatAgri, and Ola. Additionally, some international companies, such as Accenture, that have a sizeable chunk of workers in India have also laid off workers. In recent event Accenture revealed that it is laying off as many as 19,000 workers in fear of a worsening global economy. This is about 2.5 per cent of its workforce.My POV- layoffs are not the only way to make a profit. While reducing labor costs through layoffs can be one strategy to improve profitability in certain situations, it is not the sole or exclusive method. Profitability can be achieved through various means, including 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞, 𝐂𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲, 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐬.It's important to note that while layoffs can reduce immediate costs, they can also have negative consequences, such as decreased morale, loss of institutional knowledge, and potential impacts on company reputation. Therefore, it's essential for companies to consider a range of strategies and approaches to achieve sustainable profitability while also considering the well-being of their employees and maintaining a positive organisational culture.#Recession #Layoffs #Tech #IT #Technology #Mobcoder #India"

"Hard Work Laid Off 😔It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of work.But it's important to remember that your health and well-being are more important than anything else.Be Sure to Follow these Guidelines1. Don't sacrifice your health for your job. Working long hours and sleeping at the office may seem like a good way to impress your boss, but it's not sustainable in the long run. It's important to take care of yourself both physically and mentally.2. Don't be afraid to say no. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, it's okay to say no to new projects or responsibilities. 3. Set boundaries with your work. It's important to set boundaries between your work life and your personal life. This means not checking work emails or taking work calls outside of work hours. It also means not working on personal projects during work hours.4. Find a work-life balance. Everyone is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. Experiment with different ways to find a work-life balance that works for you.It is true that even the best performers can be laid off, regardless of how hard they work or how many awards they have received.Remember, being laid off is not a reflection of your worth as a person or employee. It is simply a business decision that is often out of your control.If you take care of your health and growth, even if you are laid off from a company, you still have a chance to get a new job.#twitter #layoffs #elonmusk #job"

"Sylvia Duran Chen was shocked to be laid off from her YouTube job after almost nine years at Google.The job perks and mission mattered to her, and she'd felt proud to have been chosen by Google.But when layoffs happened, she said she felt rejected, ashamed, and like all her insecurities had been proven correct.

"Call a layoff a layoff. Not a RIF. Companies use euphemisms to minimize culpability. In the case of layoffs being mysteriously rebranded as RIFs, companies reposition layoffs as a natural and essential part of corporate process. They are not. And layoffs have significant, negative health effects. From Harvard Business Review: “Being laid off ranks seventh among the most stressful life experiences — above divorce […]It takes, on average, two years to recover from the psychological trauma of losing a job […]The odds of developing a new health condition rise by 83% in the first 15 to 18 months after a layoff […]Displaced workers have twice the risk of developing depression, four times the risk of substance abuse, and six times the risk of committing violent acts including partner and child abuse. The stress induced by a layoff can even impair fetal development.” By exculpating the employer through minimising the seriousness of mass layoffs, we are in danger of minimising too the grave impact that layoffs can have on individuals, families, and communities. Layoffs need to be treated as such, and euphemisms only further harm the people that are effected just the same. That said, if you have been laid off and need support in anyway I can offer it — reach out. I will help however I can. #layoffs #layoffsupport"

"Being laid off from Netflix last year really messed with my professional self-confidence. It’s still not 100% back to where it was before the layoff, TBH. Sometimes I’ll second-guess my ideas or my work in a way that I didn’t used to before #layoff. I’m talking to a lot of laid off folks lately who are also struggling with self doubt and are questioning their qualifications and capabilities. It’s even harder now to land a solid new job than it was last year when I was looking. I can’t fix your self confidence (I wish 🙏), but I can reassure you are NOT the only one feeling very insecure and maybe even embarrassed after a layoff. It’s normal. I wish we talked about the emotional affects of layoffs and job searches more. There’s no shame in how you’re feeling. It’s valid and common. We are in this together. ♥️ Sending anyone who’s feeling that self doubt right now some love, and a reminder: you’re just as valuable and capable as you were before the layoff. Onward!"

A fictional startup considers alternative cost-cutting measures over a second round of layoffs.
"It’s really interesting to me that many of the companies that trailblazed remote work are now requiring return to office. Are people really working harder in a cubicle with florescent lighting on a strict 9-5 schedule?Does it make managers ✨feel✨ better when they can look over to physically see their direct reports and if they're working hard enough?Or maybe it's not a trust issue... Maybe it's that they paid for offices and don't want them to be vacant. Which is fair, but they have to be paid for no matter what. So why make employees spend more time and money throughout their day to make the company feel better about their office? Remember, these are the same companies that have mercilessly laid off hundreds of thousands of employees over the past year.As long as the work is getting done, who cares ✨where✨ it's getting done?And if it benefits the employees' mental health, happiness, and work life balance, even better! I personally don't think I'd trade my desk treadmill and the ability to work from the beach for anything. I'm a better person and employee because of it.Side note: it would be really cool if the government or a charity bought vacant offices and turned them into homeless shelters and women's shelters.

"How can you help your friends or colleagues who have been impacted by layoffs?This is truly an interesting job market now and being laid off comes with lots of challenges as we know. But there are things you can do to help as we navigate finding our next role.    Help their post on LinkedIn get reach outside of their own network. Help them get visibility by simply liking their post or adding a comment. This then shows up on your feed and someone in your network might have the perfect opportunity for them.     Offer a Listening Ear: Be there to listen and provide emotional support. Let them express their feelings, frustrations, and fears without judgment. Sometimes, a compassionate ear can make a world of difference.    Share Job Opportunities: Keep an eye out for job openings and share relevant opportunities with your friends or colleagues. Networking connections or online job boards can be great sources to find potential positions.    Provide Recommendations and References: If you've worked closely with them or have knowledge of their skills, offer to write a recommendation or serve as a reference for their job applications. A positive endorsement can boost their chances of landing an interview.    Practice Interviewing: Conduct mock interviews to help them prepare for potential job interviews. Offer constructive feedback, share common interview questions, and assist them in showcasing their strengths and experiences effectively.    Introduce Them to Your Network: If you have contacts in their industry or know someone who may be able to help, make introductions. Facilitating networking opportunities can expand their professional connections and increase their chances of finding new opportunities.    Provide Skill Enhancement Resources: Share relevant online courses, workshops, or resources that can help them enhance their skills or learn new ones. Upskilling or acquiring in-demand competencies can make them more marketable to potential employers.    Offer Emotional Support: Remind them that their worth is not defined by their job status. Encourage them to focus on self-care, maintain a positive mindset, and explore new possibilities. Your encouragement can help them stay motivated during their job search.Remember, the little gestures of support can go a long way in helping our friends or colleagues navigate the challenges of a layoff. Together we can lend a helping hand and hopefully get them hired quicker! #networking #linkedin #opportunities #opentowork"
"The great shakeout in the world’s fake meat sector is happening on a large scale. Investors have sharply reduced funding while inflation has increased production costs and made consumers more selective about their food choices. That’s hitting a crowded field, which had grown quickly after the early success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.  Enthusiasm for alternatives to beef and pork surged after Beyond Meat’s 2019 initial public offering (IPO), and venture capitalists were willing to invest in companies that still didn’t have a product.  But sales haven’t reached the once wildly optimistic projections, as high prices and odd tastes and textures have made the costly products easy for consumers to cross off their shopping lists. Many vegans also prefer natural than processed foods. The spate of failures extends from plant-based proteins and vertical farmers to insect breeders and lab-grown meats.  The downturn has so far claimed many #startups, most of them small:U.S.: Unreal Food, Cows Gone Coconut, Sun Milk, OceanTastes, and Noops;U.K.: The Meatless Farm, Plant & Bean, and Remastered Foods; Canada: Merit Foods, Nabati Foods, and Fresh Start  Two of the larger startups: Meatless Farms laid off staff at its headquarters while Plant & Bean got hit by soaring food and energy prices just two years after opening a mega factory in Lincolnshire. Industry stalwarts have also stumbled. Beyond Meat has seen its market value drop over 90% from its peak and has had multiple rounds of layoffs in the past year, as has Impossible Foods. Cuts have also affected Spain’s Heura Foods and California-based Eat Just, which has continued to expand distribution in the US.  Traditional food companies are also retrenching. Nestle SA pulled its Garden Gourmet line and Wunda pea milk from the UK because of intense competition. Meat giant JBS SA discontinued its Planterra unit after investing money into a mega factory in Colorado.  The good news is that global demand for meat and seafood substitutes is climbing, albeit the growth rate is in the single digits. And surveys show that about two-thirds of young consumers are planning to spend more on vegan meat and dairy products in the #future citing #health perceptions and #environmental benefits such as lower greenhouse gases (#ghgemissions, #climatechange). Thus, some remain optimistic.  The other alternative is laboratory meat. A few products have been approved for consumption, but costs are much higher than expected, and thus even if more products are approved, the #startups may never turn a profit. #technology #innovation #hype #food"
"I've built my career by growing SaaS startups, but my first job out of business school was at a shrinking company in a disappearing industry. Sabre served (still does, actually) the airline industry with a lot of software and data products. But the core offering was connecting travel agencies to airline inventory so that agents had real-time visibility and ability to book - which, in 2002, was no longer a proprietary advantage thanks to the Internet.Three lessons I learned in that environment:❤️ Lesson One: If your customers don't love you, you're living on borrowed time. In my first week I sat in on a meeting with a VP from a major airline (might've been Delta, I don't remember for sure). I was the data and analytics guy, so I brought the data to show that booking through Sabre would be cheaper than selling direct.""I know, and I don't care,"" the VP replied. ""You guys have had us over a barrel for decades. That's not true anymore, and I'm happy to pay more per booking to screw you guys.""Since then, I've made it a priority to only market products that were worth loving from a customer perspective.🧠 Lesson Two: you, not your employer, own keeping your skills and knowledge current. Because the company was shrinking, we had layoffs every November. The fresh MBAs like me were not at risk. The people at risk were the people who'd spent thirty years there. The people who'd given their heart and soul to the company. The people who had an encyclopedic knowledge of legacy systems and the two-letter codes airlines used to communicate with agencies over dedicated terminals.When you're laid off, skills like that don't even equip you to ask ""Would you like fries with that.""Since then, I've kept learning, working to learn from others, to jump on new technology and learn as much as I can about it. ❓ Lesson Three: Optimizing for shareholder value incentives companies to be amoral - but you don't have to be a d!ck about it.In the early 2000's there was a move to deregulate the GDS industry (the industry that companies like Sabre were in, distributing airline inventory). The rationale was that airlines no longer owned any of the GDSs. Our leadership supported that deregulation, saying it would make us more competitive, and encouraged us to sign petitions, etc. Team members felt proud when our CEO testified before Congress about it, and deregulation occurred shortly after. Team members felt differently when we had layoffs and were told that deregulation was a big part of the cause. ""This new deregulated environment will be more competitive"", they said, ""so our cost structure has to become leaner in order to keep up.""D!ck move, I think you'll agree.Since then, I've...well, I've tried not to be a d!ck. I've had to do layoffs (and been laid off). I've had to fire people (and been fired). In any of those situations, you can choose to be human first. At least you can be real and not rely on talking points."
"Two years ago, tech hiring was difficult for recruiters - lots of jobs, lots of compensation to compete against, and tough to find (and close) the right candidates.  It’s difficult today because of too few jobs, much stricter compensation options, and so many great candidates to evaluate.  These are two different modes of difficulty.  (And of course add today’s difficulty of the omnipresent stress of layoff risks to their job.)I was talking to a fellow jobseeker last week about how in both modes of difficulty, some recruiters will ghost whenever a jobseeker is no longer a viable candidate vs. directly communicating “you are not a fit” or “we have hired another candidate.”Today, though, where jobseekers are laid off or worried about more layoffs, job opportunities are relatively few, and each conversation with a recruiter, or lack thereof, holds a lot more weight in the job search, ghosting has a much bigger effect.Thanks to the recruiters who end communication with jobseekers gracefully, especially in this market.  It’s extra work, especially with so many candidates, but it is appreciated.#hiring #jobsearch #communication #recruiters"

The big picture? Post-pandemic layoffs and budget cuts mean big tech companies that can no longer overpay to win the best talent. An unprecedented 166K tech layoffs happened in Q1 2023 – more than in all of 2022. And 69% of FAANG engineers who were laid off or left after Q2 2022 still listed no current job at the end of Q1 2023. But early-stage startups hired 82% more of the ex-FAANG engineers vs 2021, showing the power shift!

"In this uncertain economy, it's crucial to recognize that the job market is undergoing significant changes. Navigating these new and challenging waters requires careful planning and strategy. Make a plan and set some goals. Then, make a backup plan and new goals.  Why is being strategic in this job market so important? Over 210K individuals were laid off in tech in the past 6 months. That's not including those who've been job searching long before 2023, those just entering the workforce, and those looking for a passive job change. Job requisitions went from around a hundred applicants in the span of a few weeks to the span of mere hours. Recruiting teams have been depleted to bare bones and are running on fumes while fearing for their own job security. It is a mess.Being strategic with your job search will save you time and stress. ▶ Networking becomes paramount in these circumstances. Build meaningful relationships with people in talent acquisition and those outside of it. Be the expert in your own career. Rather than asking someone to do the mental labor of figuring out what role best fits you, show up prepared and know your qualifications and how they align to specific roles. Read open jobs and take a hard look at your own experience from the lens of an outside party to ensure you're showcasing yourself as the best possible candidate. Reaching out to someone? Be intentional with your message.▶ Invest in acquiring new skills that align with the evolving demands of the job market. Take free courses, join groups, and sign up for that website that interests you. By expanding your skill set, you enhance your competitiveness and adaptability. Become the subject matter expert. These are also great topics for conversations in networking and interviewing!▶ Consider opening up your limitations for your next job. Narrowed search parameters mean narrowed results. Many companies are rolling back on remote policies and encouraging employees back in the office. This means that fully remote roles will be limited in number and desired by many - teams will be picky with applicants for these high-volume roles. Are there areas you can compromise? Do the research on what's open right now and consider the option that best fits you and your situation. Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Acknowledge your efforts and celebrate any small win. It'll keep you driving forward and self motivate. Your self-worth does not always equal your profession, your skills and knowledge have value. I'm rooting for you. #jobsearch #networking #recruiting #careeradvice #layoffs #resume #talentacquisition"

While I don't think you necessairly have to put in hundreds of applications and you can be more creative about your approach adopting strategies not mentioned here, I very much agree that you should use this time to re-assess and re-evaluate your options and what you truly want. Also, not accepting the first thing that comes along, if suboptimal, is something I'd advise too. Acting from desperation and fear vs. acting from the place of moving forward with a vision, are 2 different things!I empower my clients to do just that, as I take them from ""I can’t do it”     ➡️     “Can I do it?”    ➡️ ”I’ve done it!”What points from the article resonate with you?https://lnkd.in/enKaNgxM #careerchange #consciousdecisions #careertransition #careerprogression"

"Why is it important for journalists to talk to people? In a rush to file stories, a lot of us miss an important aspect of our stories. People. A few days ago, while covering layoffs, I spoke to a few BYJU's employees who were just laid off. They opened up a lot and that's when one of them asked me ""you know that they haven't been paying our PF money, right?"" I rushed to my bosses with this info, who in turn wanted me to cross-check this. A few sources confirmed this and by evening, I had payslips and PF statements. I ended up talking to more people over the weekend and it literally opened a can of worms. And that was when the idea of checking the EPFO data came up (Thanks to a risk specialist friend and the Hindu Group HR for helping out here)! And that was it. Everything pointed towards the same thing!This is the story here, which we got to know, just because someone shared their story, the old-school way. A businessline exclusive"

"Whats happening with Byju's? The following pointers capture the series of events:1. July 2022 : ToppR, White-hat junior: both laid off 500 employees2. Sept 2022 : Filed FY 21 earnings : 18 month delayed (supposed to be filed 6 months)3. The FY 21 financials showed 4500 Cr Losses (13X higher loss YoY) 4. Nov 2022 : Valuation cut internally from $22 Billion to $11 Billion5. 1.2 Billion dollars of debt was raised to ensure completion of acquisition of Aakash. However Byju's sued the lenders claiming 'acceleration of the borrowing' and also seeked disqualification of Redwood, the Key lender. 6. Feb 2023: Byjus layoffs approx 1500 employees7. April 2023: major NBFCs suspended lending to Byju's customers. This is massive as a huge number of Byju's users do depend on these loan providers given the offering range of 20k to 140k Rs8. June 2023: Deloitte resigns from the position of Byju's statutory auditor raising concerns on delay in FY 22 filing9. June 2023: 3 board of directors resigned *Before we sensationalise this series of events and talk about the one big bad , lets go deeper into the #macroeconomics changes that have happened at the same time: - #demand Changes:  Covid years inflated the demand for online education massively. Post Covid era with offline schooling back in place, the ecosystem has changed. The demand naturally has gone down, making current valuations of the company very difficult to defend- #acquisition decisions : White-hat jr 2020, Aakash and Toppr in 2021The acquisition decisions were made in a market which was TopLine focused and with that context, these decisions at that time made sense. The current market is majorly a function of Unit Economics. The market focus change now makes these very questionable decisions - The #domino Effect: Once the NBFCs cut off the lendings, Byju's had to rely on inhouse offering, Byju's Assure , Byju's Advantage and Byju's direct. Given Byju's isn't a expert into lending, this movement is making running the business both very capital intensive as well as very riskyMultiple macro factors have come to cause the sequence of events which is leading to the institute's struggle. In any outlying situation good or bad, it's very easy to romanticise a hero or a villian,  but never is the reality this simple. Both situations take a bunch of environmental factor, a group of people taking right or wrong decisions, a bucket loads of luck, good or bad. Not taking away responsibility, at this time the company needs to come clean on its financials, be realistic about its valuation, develop the omni-channel approach which its already started with Aakash. Best thing for our entire ecosystem is Byju's coming out of this a winner and thats what we should root for!  #business #byjus #events #startup #governance"
"Layoffs are the worst thing when you are going through, but the best thing when you look back.When I got laid off it was the toughest period of my life. I lost both my mom & job at the same time. I did not know where to begin, how to begin, what to do. But I remember I had clarity that I would not waste a minute & regret later.Almost 2 years everything I tried did not work out. But thankfully I had by then started to enjoy the journey. I was not fighting anything or running after anything. It was a good space.As I shifted inside my life started to change outside. I started to think about what truly gives me joy & it was writing. I also wanted to make a difference to people's lives. As I started to write who knew it could help other people in their journey. It was as if the universe had given me a gift which would give me joy & help fulfil my purpose.Life is a setup by the universe the sooner we understand the better. Layoffs are beautiful!What do you think?Register for our career lab workshop at:https://lnkd.in/dsDEzdAz #career #layoffs #jobs"
"Never waste a layoff. Four lessons from my experience.Layoffs in the tech industry have slowed down. But, we are not done yet. Grab, the biggest homegrown name in tech announced sizeable layoffs this week. If you are one who was affected, remember the Persian saying, “this too shall pass”.Here are four lessons I learned from my own layoff experience.First, focus on self care and what really matters, namely health, family and friends. I assume you had to deprioritise at least one of these in the quest to give your best at a fast moving company like Grab. Now is the time to set the balance right, at least a little bit. By focusing on health, family and friends you will gain both energy and joy in multiples. That will set you in the right frame of mind for the upcoming job search.Second, if your financial and immigration status allows, give yourself space and time. I recommend taking a month off where you do not kick off a job search. Take this time to recharge and reflect.I used my post layoff time to reflect on what makes me truly happy, what gives me energy, and what I am curious about. I also reflected on my life’s priorities, and my how I was performing on those priorities. I then put some fixes in place for priorities I had been neglecting. What I reflected on are ideas that may or may not be relevant to you. Pick what you reflect on based on your context & introspection. I have found quiet reflective breaks to be very energising. I hope you do too!Third, focus on the convergence of energy and curiosity. Find at least one activity that gives you energy and you are curious about. It could be anything at all and does not have to be work related. Start doing more of that activity. If possible, start teaching / sharing more about that activity with others. In doing so, you will share energy with others who need it. Be the energy giver!Fourth, avoid getting bogged down by the question, ""why me?"". There is no good answer for it. Large scale layoffs are a spreadsheet exercise. They are not about you or your performance. Getting laid off sucks. It hurts in many ways. But it is also an opportunity. Don’t waste it.All the best, and remember, “this too shall pass”.(Edit: my original post offered a free coaching session to those impacted, but unfortunately I have been overwhelmed with requests. Therefore pausing my offer till I finish helping those who have already reached out)"
"5000+ fired staff’s curses finally begin to blow on BYJU'S!After resignation of Deloitte and 3 key board members in a day, $22 billion BYJU’S now seems busy in launching paid campaigns to cover up all news.Publications like Moneycontrol, The Federal News, and India Today have recently talked about its great work culture!😂But reality is,1. Layoffs: It’s forced 24X7 working juniors to senior leaders like senior managers, VPs, and associate VPs to resign to save ESOPs and salaries.2. Lowered Salaries: Employee salaries declined from Rs 10 Lakh/annum to Rs 7 Lakh to 5 Lakh/annum or lesser.3. Shut down:It's closed its training division and reduced pre-sales department by 90%.Now, several state employee unions are in talks to go to Union Labor Minister against its serious labor law violations.Although I posted last year about the total number of laid-off employees of BYJU’S may cross 12,000 in 2023, few people called me a fraud. Now, it’s coming up!📉Though BYJU’S denied reports of exit of 3 board members:- Sequoia Capital's India arm.-  Prosus.- Chan Zuckerberg.Inc42 Media said they’ve found dissimilarities in operational issues with founder BYJU.For example,- It’s strange when BYJU acquired a 30% stake for Rs 1983 Cr in its biggest subsidiary Aakash. He did it in private as he missed payment deadline to BlackRock and other promoters of Aakash’s deal. - He secured funds from Qatar Investment Authority which provided them with an unofficial stake in Aakash.- Even BYJU himself invested $400 million in parent company Think & Learn in March 2022.It’s a huge issue of complicated payments for 100+ investors as BYJU’S is taking Aakash to IPO in 2024.It seems BYJU was playing snake and ladder with funds and stakes.😂As it’s yet to release its FY22 results which ended on 31st March 2022, it's appointed BDO (MSKA & Associates) as its new auditor.You may see BDO will leave BYJU's in a month or two.On another hand, BYJU’S is already stuck for its $1.2 billion loan repayment and hidden loan of $500 million where it’s facing lawsuits in US. After raising $6 billion in total, BYJU’S now faces a probe from the Ministry Of Corporate Affairs due to corporate governance lapses.PS- With an overflow of funds and a drought of communication, BYJU’S has become a perfect example which will be never followed.Even BYJU'S employees said they've run out of money after raising Rs 2000 Cr a month ago!😅Can BYJU’s survive this storm?Do you think the end of the ed-sales giant is near?Follow #debcreates and Debonkar now for such case studies on startups, brands, and CEOs!🔥 #india #sales #startup #legal #investing #finance"
"The organizations who are laying off left, right and centre right now, are the same organizations who will be looking for stability in a candidate, once they get into hiring spree,again!And the candidate whom they have fired - their stability will be questioned 7-8 months from now.You also have people who feels if a candidate was laid off then candidate would have been non performer. woaaaa i know companies who had laid off 30-50% of employees in the pretence of non performance. well CEO should be fired first if 30% employees are non performers or perhaps the defination of non performance is not well defined.Disappointing fact - the onus of proving stability is only on candidate. If a candidate has hopped multiple times in a year's time or even less then its assumed that it was candidate's fault / candidate is job hopper / candidate is unstable! Thinking and mindset of most of the organizations in today point of time where hashtag of #opentowork has massive taggings. fellas who are facing tough time finding a job - stay strong, this too shall pass! #hiring #mindset #job #layoff #hiringspree #culture #aggressivehiring #startup #startupculture"

"Are you ready for a layoff?In today's world, things are moving very fast. Organizations that were hiring frenetically a few months ago have started downsizing and laying off people. They may even start hiring again in the very near future.Unlike the olden days, today, there is nothing like ""job security"".This volatile business cycle of companies is not just restricted to IT organizations. We have seen selective layoffs arising at even C-Suite levels as a consequence of redundancies due to mergers, demergers, M&As, and corporate restructuring/restrategizing.In the USA, such layoffs are quite common. We have heard of een professionals being laid off 3 and 4 times in their careers.In India, such a situation is a recent phenomenon.Are you prepared to face a layoff if such a situation does arise in your Career?We help Professionals effectively manage such ""crisis"" situations.We guide you in Career-Continuity, JSS / Job-Search Strategies, and Career Success. Some of our recent successes (where we have guided candidates to reach the below positions): 1.

"Abruptly, hundreds of Byju's employees got to know last Friday (June 16) that it was their last working day. In addition to this, the impacted employees' email addresses were discontinued and official identity cards were confiscated. And now, a fresh report states that the remaining employees' morale has taken a huge hit amidst the layoffs and employees want to leave the organisation in fear of getting fired overnight.“Morale is at an all-time low. Literally every person has a job portal open on their laptop at all times. Everyone wants to leave desperately before they are asked to pack up overnight,” a senior manager at Byju's said, requesting to be anonymous. The manager further added that the situation right now is that managers and their subordinates are sitting together, looking for new jobs.The laid-off employees will get two months' salary as severance and their full and final settlement should reach them by September-October, or about 45 days after July. After this, no extra severance will be given by the company.Follow for more!#tech #technews #byjus #layoff #update"
"This is what a layoff can lead too. A lot of companies after the start of pandemic has started following this unethical practice of laying off their staff just to earn more profits without considering how much the life of a laid off employee will get affected. Many such posts have come on my LinkedIn feeds where an employee has been laid off 2 or 4 or 6 months back and still he/she has not got a job in the market even after giving hundreds of interviews. They all are battling depression in their personal lives due to the unethical practice of layoffs and over expectations of recruiters while recruiting a new employee. What kind of entrepreneurship mindset we entrepreneurs have! As an entrepreneur we don’t even know how to manage our Human Resource!!Whenever their is a surge in the demand we entrepreneurs start over hiring as most of the edtechs had done during pandemic and then when they realise that it is not resulting in the scale of profit as they have expected they start layoffing their employees. The same employees who had given their day and nights for the vision of company, the same employees had worked had and delivered beyond their job role expectations. Then suddenly one morning a mail appears from the CEO or the owner of the company that you are among the 25% or 50% of the layoff staff. And all this is due to lack of planning, lack of forsightedness, lack of Human Resource management. At the end the employee has to suffer due to all these mismanagement on the part of the companies. Entrepreneurs draft many values and claim their companies to be based on those values and expect that each employee should showcase and imbibe those values.But what about those values when these companies layoff their employees suddenly. I wish such companies must show their own drafted values at the time of layoffs. Atleast talk to your teams, which you always call it a family. Does any family at the time of crisis throws their family members out of the house ? If companies really think that their teams are their families then they should talk to their teams like a family before doing layoff. Tell them the situation of organization and ask them how they can help. Give them some options such as1. Ask them if they can work on reduced salaries until the situation of organization gets better.2. Ask them if they are ok with no promotions or salary hikes until the org starts to stabilise.3. WFH can be one of the options which will reduce the office cost to a great extent, which orgs are paying in crores. Now a days their is no job which can’t be done remotely if proper KPI’s are drafted and a proper reporting system is created. If employees are not open for such options  then the layoffs should be the last option and I am sure most of the employees will be open for these options. Wishing all the best to all who got laid off and are in the search of a new job."
"It is far from being over - the firefight is still going on.According to data, 2023 probably wasn't the year for India's start-up ecosystem, and the layoff season is far from being over. According to data from layoff.fyi, at least 10,774 employees have been laid off till June 23.#layoff2023 #startup #fintech"
"We are facing layoffs and  job insecurity issues these days. An Individual living in the fear of getting laidoff or not being able to secure his/her place in the organisation increased lack of sense of belonging, disturbed mind, Inferiority complex these days.Layoffs can indeed have adverse effects on the lives of individuals, particularly those in the middle class. When layoffs occur, it often disrupts the financial stability, well-being, and overall prospects of those affected. Let's consider some adverse effects- * Financial instability: Losing a job can result in an immediate loss of income, creating financial strain for individuals and their families. Middle-class individuals often have certain financial commitments, such as mortgage payments, car loans, and education expenses, which may become challenging to meet without a steady income. This can lead to accumulating debt, difficulty maintaining a standard of living, and even the risk of falling out of the middle class.*Reduced job prospects: During times of layoffs, the job market becomes more competitive as more people are searching for work. This can make it harder for those who have been laid off to find new employment. Individuals may find it difficult to secure a job that matches their previous income and job level, leading to a potential downward shift in their career trajectory.* Emotional and psychological impact: Losing a job can have a significant emotional toll on individuals. It can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, depression and a loss of self-esteem. Individuals may face additional pressures due to their financial obligations, which can further exacerbate these emotional challenges. * Disruption of future plans: Individuals often have long-term plans related to savings, homeownership, education for their children, and other aspirations. Layoffs can result in a loss of progress and opportunities for personal and financial growth.* Health and well-being: Financial stress, job insecurity, and emotional distress resulting from layoffs can have adverse effects on physical and mental health. Increased stress levels can lead to a variety of health problems, including high BP, heart disease, and mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Middle-class individuals may struggle to access healthcare services and support systems during this challenging period.Governments, organizations, and communities should implement measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of layoffs, such as unemployment benefits, job training programs, and support networks.#work #growth #job #future #mentalhealth #help #employment #layoffs #people #competition #opportunities #worklifebalance"
"In 2022, a total of 1,052 tech companies had laid off 1,61,411 employees [ source : layoffs. fyi]The numbers are worse for 2023. 🥺A Layoff is loss of job from factors beyond one’s control. While a Layoff cannot be controlled, one can take charge of their income. Being in charge makes you comfortable during the mentally draining time that starts immediately when a Layoff is announced and continues till you get a job you would like to work for. Having monetary support for 3-4 months of salary can empower you during this situation and help you make the decision that is best for you instead of making a compromise. Last week in the news, I read about Jobsurance . I mean they really came up with a whole new idea for this challenging time.Jobsurance lets you take matters into your own hands because if you won't do it then no one else will.

"Meta recently laid of 21,000 people.  12,000 Google employees - gone.  I think people have a right to be pissed.  But behind the anger, there's a bigger opportunity.  An opportunity to prepare.  Because when profit is down, shareholders are panicked, and board members are upset, layoffs are the next thing coming.  One moment you're a valuable piece of the ""family"", and then suddenly you aren't.  That sucks.  No matter how loved you feel, no matter how close you are to your boss, no matter how much they rolled out the red carpet...in the end?  It's a math decision.  You're a number on a spreadsheet.  I've been there.  Is it fair? Maybe not. Is it true? 100%  The earlier you realize this in your career, the better off you are.  So start future-proofing yourself.  If you're fortunate enough to be employed, start building out your online brand, share your thoughts & learnings, and engage with other talented people.  Create small side hustles and projects.  Network like HELL. Make yourself impossible to forget.  Become synonymous with something that can generate a little income should you need it. Anything.  If you've been let go from your job, don't put the ""Open for Work"" badge on your profile.  Instead, go create something:  - Attention - Content - Software - A newsletter - A blog - Audio - Video  Whatever. Just create!  Don't tell people you're open for work.

"Here's why I would advise recruiters to not hire laid off candidates for a pay cut.The recession has been hard on all of us. A lot of tech jobs were eliminated and many people were laid off most for reasons not related to performance . A good number of my friends were unfortunately part of those layoffs and it was really sad to see them frustrated and depressed for getting back to the job market . Some of my friends searched for months while some got placed in days. Almost all of them  had to take a  pay cut ranging from few lakhs to some as much as 40%. However here's something funny I realized while connecting with them recently. Every single one of them has switched by now to another job that paid them more or equal to when they got laid off. All they did at their intermediate job was leetcode and apply. They never cared about performance at job because they were simply not going to stay there.Not to mention most of them were a nightmare to their managers. Imagine an employee who just doesn't care. Frequently missing standups, not replying to managers , poorly released prs, missing deadlines were just few of the many troubles their managers had to face as a reward for hiring them.Once a person has recieved a significant salary he/she can never be satisfied  for a lower paycheck. Its basic human nature . You don't want ur company to be the rebound for the candidate till he gets a better job. If u have a decent budget like most of those companies did it's much better to hire someone with a lower previous compensation. Trust me a happy dumb employee is going to be deliver more value than a smart unhappy one."
"Were you a part of the recent layoffs ⁉️Well, I have been in the past..The anxiety and uncertainty that comes when you lose your current job is unmatched. The very first day after the news is broken to you is the most difficult one to spend. The future becomes uncertain, and it can be challenging to determine one’s next steps. Fortunately, I received a generous severance package, when I was laid off & it offered some financial stability for a few months. However, not all companies offer the same level of support, and one can never predict when another round of layoffs may occur within an organization.Recently, I came across a platform called Jobsurance  and I was pleasantly surprised by the services they offer. Jobsurance  is one of India's first income protection plan specifically designed to safeguard salaried employees against job loss. What I like about it is that even if you lose your job, you don't lose your income and lifestyle. It's truly remarkable!

"Big tech giants have laid off approximately 54,000 employees from Jan to June 2023!To say that tech companies have been affected by the recession would be an understatement.

Rather, to show you the other side of layoffs and help you become recession-proof.Let's consider these facts before losing hope and hearing the layoff news!👉The tech industry is growing despite the recession👉FAAMG companies are still profitable because of their record of innovation and growthNow, here are a few things you need to do to ensure you have a job:✅Network with other tech professionals. Networking is one of the best ways to find a job. Attend industry events, join online forums, and reach out to people you know in tech. A lot of freshers DM with their queries and I try to help as much as I can. If not, I create a post, just like this! 👀✅Keep your skills up to date. This may sound cliche but give at least an hour to learn whatever is happening in the tech industry as it is constantly changing.✅Be flexible. The job market for tech workers is competitive, so you may need to be flexible with your location, salary, or job title.

"𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡-𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚?As layoffs continue to rock the tech world, Indian companies are no exception to the sad trend that has left many in the tech and startup economy jobless. Virtual learning providers - major pandemic winners - have been the hardest hit now that global markets are transitioning away from the pandemic economy. According to the layoff tracking website, layoff.fyi in 2023 have already surpassed the numbers last year. In 2022, 1056 tech companies decided to cut jobs across sectors, impacting nearly 1.64 lakh workers throughout the year. In India, several tech companies have taken harsh measures to cut jobs and save money. The companies include Dunzo, Sharechat, Rebel Foods, BharatAgri, and Ola. Additionally, some international companies, such as Accenture, that have a sizeable chunk of workers in India have also laid off workers. In recent event Accenture revealed that it is laying off as many as 19,000 workers in fear of a worsening global economy. This is about 2.5 per cent of its workforce.My POV- layoffs are not the only way to make a profit. While reducing labor costs through layoffs can be one strategy to improve profitability in certain situations, it is not the sole or exclusive method. Profitability can be achieved through various means, including 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞, 𝐂𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐲, 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐬.It's important to note that while layoffs can reduce immediate costs, they can also have negative consequences, such as decreased morale, loss of institutional knowledge, and potential impacts on company reputation. Therefore, it's essential for companies to consider a range of strategies and approaches to achieve sustainable profitability while also considering the well-being of their employees and maintaining a positive organisational culture.#Recession #Layoffs #Tech #IT #Technology #Mobcoder #India"

"Hard Work Laid Off 😔It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of work.But it's important to remember that your health and well-being are more important than anything else.Be Sure to Follow these Guidelines1. Don't sacrifice your health for your job. Working long hours and sleeping at the office may seem like a good way to impress your boss, but it's not sustainable in the long run. It's important to take care of yourself both physically and mentally.2. Don't be afraid to say no. If you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, it's okay to say no to new projects or responsibilities. 3. Set boundaries with your work. It's important to set boundaries between your work life and your personal life. This means not checking work emails or taking work calls outside of work hours. It also means not working on personal projects during work hours.4. Find a work-life balance. Everyone is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. Experiment with different ways to find a work-life balance that works for you.It is true that even the best performers can be laid off, regardless of how hard they work or how many awards they have received.Remember, being laid off is not a reflection of your worth as a person or employee. It is simply a business decision that is often out of your control.If you take care of your health and growth, even if you are laid off from a company, you still have a chance to get a new job.#twitter #layoffs #elonmusk #job"

"Call a layoff a layoff. Not a RIF. Companies use euphemisms to minimize culpability. In the case of layoffs being mysteriously rebranded as RIFs, companies reposition layoffs as a natural and essential part of corporate process. They are not. And layoffs have significant, negative health effects. From Harvard Business Review: “Being laid off ranks seventh among the most stressful life experiences — above divorce […]It takes, on average, two years to recover from the psychological trauma of losing a job […]The odds of developing a new health condition rise by 83% in the first 15 to 18 months after a layoff […]Displaced workers have twice the risk of developing depression, four times the risk of substance abuse, and six times the risk of committing violent acts including partner and child abuse. The stress induced by a layoff can even impair fetal development.” By exculpating the employer through minimising the seriousness of mass layoffs, we are in danger of minimising too the grave impact that layoffs can have on individuals, families, and communities. Layoffs need to be treated as such, and euphemisms only further harm the people that are effected just the same. That said, if you have been laid off and need support in anyway I can offer it — reach out. I will help however I can. #layoffs #layoffsupport"

"Being laid off from Netflix last year really messed with my professional self-confidence. It’s still not 100% back to where it was before the layoff, TBH. Sometimes I’ll second-guess my ideas or my work in a way that I didn’t used to before #layoff. I’m talking to a lot of laid off folks lately who are also struggling with self doubt and are questioning their qualifications and capabilities. It’s even harder now to land a solid new job than it was last year when I was looking. I can’t fix your self confidence (I wish 🙏), but I can reassure you are NOT the only one feeling very insecure and maybe even embarrassed after a layoff. It’s normal. I wish we talked about the emotional affects of layoffs and job searches more. There’s no shame in how you’re feeling. It’s valid and common. We are in this together. ♥️ Sending anyone who’s feeling that self doubt right now some love, and a reminder: you’re just as valuable and capable as you were before the layoff. Onward!"

A fictional startup considers alternative cost-cutting measures over a second round of layoffs.
"It’s really interesting to me that many of the companies that trailblazed remote work are now requiring return to office. Are people really working harder in a cubicle with florescent lighting on a strict 9-5 schedule?Does it make managers ✨feel✨ better when they can look over to physically see their direct reports and if they're working hard enough?Or maybe it's not a trust issue... Maybe it's that they paid for offices and don't want them to be vacant. Which is fair, but they have to be paid for no matter what. So why make employees spend more time and money throughout their day to make the company feel better about their office? Remember, these are the same companies that have mercilessly laid off hundreds of thousands of employees over the past year.As long as the work is getting done, who cares ✨where✨ it's getting done?And if it benefits the employees' mental health, happiness, and work life balance, even better! I personally don't think I'd trade my desk treadmill and the ability to work from the beach for anything. I'm a better person and employee because of it.Side note: it would be really cool if the government or a charity bought vacant offices and turned them into homeless shelters and women's shelters.

"How can you help your friends or colleagues who have been impacted by layoffs?This is truly an interesting job market now and being laid off comes with lots of challenges as we know. But there are things you can do to help as we navigate finding our next role.    Help their post on LinkedIn get reach outside of their own network. Help them get visibility by simply liking their post or adding a comment. This then shows up on your feed and someone in your network might have the perfect opportunity for them.     Offer a Listening Ear: Be there to listen and provide emotional support. Let them express their feelings, frustrations, and fears without judgment. Sometimes, a compassionate ear can make a world of difference.    Share Job Opportunities: Keep an eye out for job openings and share relevant opportunities with your friends or colleagues. Networking connections or online job boards can be great sources to find potential positions.    Provide Recommendations and References: If you've worked closely with them or have knowledge of their skills, offer to write a recommendation or serve as a reference for their job applications. A positive endorsement can boost their chances of landing an interview.    Practice Interviewing: Conduct mock interviews to help them prepare for potential job interviews. Offer constructive feedback, share common interview questions, and assist them in showcasing their strengths and experiences effectively.    Introduce Them to Your Network: If you have contacts in their industry or know someone who may be able to help, make introductions. Facilitating networking opportunities can expand their professional connections and increase their chances of finding new opportunities.    Provide Skill Enhancement Resources: Share relevant online courses, workshops, or resources that can help them enhance their skills or learn new ones. Upskilling or acquiring in-demand competencies can make them more marketable to potential employers.    Offer Emotional Support: Remind them that their worth is not defined by their job status. Encourage them to focus on self-care, maintain a positive mindset, and explore new possibilities. Your encouragement can help them stay motivated during their job search.Remember, the little gestures of support can go a long way in helping our friends or colleagues navigate the challenges of a layoff. Together we can lend a helping hand and hopefully get them hired quicker! #networking #linkedin #opportunities #opentowork"
"The great shakeout in the world’s fake meat sector is happening on a large scale. Investors have sharply reduced funding while inflation has increased production costs and made consumers more selective about their food choices. That’s hitting a crowded field, which had grown quickly after the early success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.  Enthusiasm for alternatives to beef and pork surged after Beyond Meat’s 2019 initial public offering (IPO), and venture capitalists were willing to invest in companies that still didn’t have a product.  But sales haven’t reached the once wildly optimistic projections, as high prices and odd tastes and textures have made the costly products easy for consumers to cross off their shopping lists. Many vegans also prefer natural than processed foods. The spate of failures extends from plant-based proteins and vertical farmers to insect breeders and lab-grown meats.  The downturn has so far claimed many #startups, most of them small:U.S.: Unreal Food, Cows Gone Coconut, Sun Milk, OceanTastes, and Noops;U.K.: The Meatless Farm, Plant & Bean, and Remastered Foods; Canada: Merit Foods, Nabati Foods, and Fresh Start  Two of the larger startups: Meatless Farms laid off staff at its headquarters while Plant & Bean got hit by soaring food and energy prices just two years after opening a mega factory in Lincolnshire. Industry stalwarts have also stumbled. Beyond Meat has seen its market value drop over 90% from its peak and has had multiple rounds of layoffs in the past year, as has Impossible Foods. Cuts have also affected Spain’s Heura Foods and California-based Eat Just, which has continued to expand distribution in the US.  Traditional food companies are also retrenching. Nestle SA pulled its Garden Gourmet line and Wunda pea milk from the UK because of intense competition. Meat giant JBS SA discontinued its Planterra unit after investing money into a mega factory in Colorado.  The good news is that global demand for meat and seafood substitutes is climbing, albeit the growth rate is in the single digits. And surveys show that about two-thirds of young consumers are planning to spend more on vegan meat and dairy products in the #future citing #health perceptions and #environmental benefits such as lower greenhouse gases (#ghgemissions, #climatechange). Thus, some remain optimistic.  The other alternative is laboratory meat. A few products have been approved for consumption, but costs are much higher than expected, and thus even if more products are approved, the #startups may never turn a profit. #technology #innovation #hype #food"
"I've built my career by growing SaaS startups, but my first job out of business school was at a shrinking company in a disappearing industry. Sabre served (still does, actually) the airline industry with a lot of software and data products. But the core offering was connecting travel agencies to airline inventory so that agents had real-time visibility and ability to book - which, in 2002, was no longer a proprietary advantage thanks to the Internet.Three lessons I learned in that environment:❤️ Lesson One: If your customers don't love you, you're living on borrowed time. In my first week I sat in on a meeting with a VP from a major airline (might've been Delta, I don't remember for sure). I was the data and analytics guy, so I brought the data to show that booking through Sabre would be cheaper than selling direct.""I know, and I don't care,"" the VP replied. ""You guys have had us over a barrel for decades. That's not true anymore, and I'm happy to pay more per booking to screw you guys.""Since then, I've made it a priority to only market products that were worth loving from a customer perspective.🧠 Lesson Two: you, not your employer, own keeping your skills and knowledge current. Because the company was shrinking, we had layoffs every November. The fresh MBAs like me were not at risk. The people at risk were the people who'd spent thirty years there. The people who'd given their heart and soul to the company. The people who had an encyclopedic knowledge of legacy systems and the two-letter codes airlines used to communicate with agencies over dedicated terminals.When you're laid off, skills like that don't even equip you to ask ""Would you like fries with that.""Since then, I've kept learning, working to learn from others, to jump on new technology and learn as much as I can about it. ❓ Lesson Three: Optimizing for shareholder value incentives companies to be amoral - but you don't have to be a d!ck about it.In the early 2000's there was a move to deregulate the GDS industry (the industry that companies like Sabre were in, distributing airline inventory). The rationale was that airlines no longer owned any of the GDSs. Our leadership supported that deregulation, saying it would make us more competitive, and encouraged us to sign petitions, etc. Team members felt proud when our CEO testified before Congress about it, and deregulation occurred shortly after. Team members felt differently when we had layoffs and were told that deregulation was a big part of the cause. ""This new deregulated environment will be more competitive"", they said, ""so our cost structure has to become leaner in order to keep up.""D!ck move, I think you'll agree.Since then, I've...well, I've tried not to be a d!ck. I've had to do layoffs (and been laid off). I've had to fire people (and been fired). In any of those situations, you can choose to be human first. At least you can be real and not rely on talking points."
"Two years ago, tech hiring was difficult for recruiters - lots of jobs, lots of compensation to compete against, and tough to find (and close) the right candidates.  It’s difficult today because of too few jobs, much stricter compensation options, and so many great candidates to evaluate.  These are two different modes of difficulty.  (And of course add today’s difficulty of the omnipresent stress of layoff risks to their job.)I was talking to a fellow jobseeker last week about how in both modes of difficulty, some recruiters will ghost whenever a jobseeker is no longer a viable candidate vs. directly communicating “you are not a fit” or “we have hired another candidate.”Today, though, where jobseekers are laid off or worried about more layoffs, job opportunities are relatively few, and each conversation with a recruiter, or lack thereof, holds a lot more weight in the job search, ghosting has a much bigger effect.Thanks to the recruiters who end communication with jobseekers gracefully, especially in this market.  It’s extra work, especially with so many candidates, but it is appreciated.#hiring #jobsearch #communication #recruiters"

The big picture? Post-pandemic layoffs and budget cuts mean big tech companies that can no longer overpay to win the best talent. An unprecedented 166K tech layoffs happened in Q1 2023 – more than in all of 2022. And 69% of FAANG engineers who were laid off or left after Q2 2022 still listed no current job at the end of Q1 2023.

"In this uncertain economy, it's crucial to recognize that the job market is undergoing significant changes. Navigating these new and challenging waters requires careful planning and strategy. Make a plan and set some goals. Then, make a backup plan and new goals.  Why is being strategic in this job market so important? Over 210K individuals were laid off in tech in the past 6 months. That's not including those who've been job searching long before 2023, those just entering the workforce, and those looking for a passive job change. Job requisitions went from around a hundred applicants in the span of a few weeks to the span of mere hours. Recruiting teams have been depleted to bare bones and are running on fumes while fearing for their own job security. It is a mess.Being strategic with your job search will save you time and stress. ▶ Networking becomes paramount in these circumstances. Build meaningful relationships with people in talent acquisition and those outside of it. Be the expert in your own career. Rather than asking someone to do the mental labor of figuring out what role best fits you, show up prepared and know your qualifications and how they align to specific roles. Read open jobs and take a hard look at your own experience from the lens of an outside party to ensure you're showcasing yourself as the best possible candidate. Reaching out to someone? Be intentional with your message.▶ Invest in acquiring new skills that align with the evolving demands of the job market. Take free courses, join groups, and sign up for that website that interests you. By expanding your skill set, you enhance your competitiveness and adaptability. Become the subject matter expert. These are also great topics for conversations in networking and interviewing!▶ Consider opening up your limitations for your next job. Narrowed search parameters mean narrowed results. Many companies are rolling back on remote policies and encouraging employees back in the office. This means that fully remote roles will be limited in number and desired by many - teams will be picky with applicants for these high-volume roles. Are there areas you can compromise? Do the research on what's open right now and consider the option that best fits you and your situation. Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Acknowledge your efforts and celebrate any small win. It'll keep you driving forward and self motivate. Your self-worth does not always equal your profession, your skills and knowledge have value.

"When Eli Chen was laid off from National Geographic, she and her roommate came up with an idea: the “layoff shower.”— ”It was a silly hypothetical at first. If people held showers for the important events in their lives, why not throw one for getting laid off?”— ”If you are a journalist (or doesn’t matter what occupation!) who’s been laid off this year and you want to throw a layoff shower, I’ll just say that there are no rules, other than to have fun and make it your own.”Read more: https://lnkd.in/gn53FsXp #layoffs #media #journalism"
"FRIDAY GOOD NEWS! Volume 86So many layoffs recently....even if you were not laid off, there's still pressure to withstand and be proactive about your career management....According to the latest data, as of the end of March this year, 250,000 people globally have been affected by lay offs.Whether you are in the tech sector, or in financial services, or consulting, you may have witnessed people aorund you losing jobs, or perhaps you experienced it first hand. I share this article giving you some excellent tips from someone who went through the entire process themselves. While I don't think you necessairly have to put in hundreds of applications and you can be more creative about your approach adopting strategies not mentioned here, I very much agree that you should use this time to re-assess and re-evaluate your options and what you truly want. Also, not accepting the first thing that comes along, if suboptimal, is something I'd advise too. Acting from desperation and fear vs. acting from the place of moving forward with a vision, are 2 different things!I empower my clients to do just that, as I take them from ""I can’t do it”     ➡️     “Can I do it?”    ➡️ ”I’ve done it!”What points from the article resonate with you?https://lnkd.in/enKaNgxM #careerchange #consciousdecisions #careertransition #careerprogression"
"I was quoted in a recent article in The American Lawyer on law firm layoffs (excerpt below).In the past months, I’ve heard from friends, former students, and other acquaintances that have been impacted by layoffs. This includes first year associates who were deferred and laid off after only a few months on the job. For a profession where we are conditioned to perform (take the LSAT, get into law school, get good grades, get a summer job offer, get a job offer, pass the bar, hit your billables), it can be a traumatic experience (even if not related to performance).Layoffs, like market cycles, are often unavoidable. That being said, it seems that much of the current downsizing is a response to aggressive hiring that took place in 2021/22. As an industry, I think we need to explore other strategies to scale to meet increased demand (to help avoid or minimize these situations in the future).And to those impacted, I’m in awe of the resilience, confidence, and empathy you’ve shown. You are fantastic and I can’t wait to see what you are going to do in your careers. ———Adam Sterling, the assistant dean for executive education and revenue generation at Berkeley Law, said that most firms need to rightsize their ranks, even if their workload is improving. But that law firms, in general, tend to be reactive in managing personnel.“Most big firms, I think they’d say they’re busier again,” Sterling said. “But law firms aren’t great about managing their head count on a regular basis. Often, they take action in response to crises. Either there’s too much work and attorneys are complaining about how much they’re billing, or the market is slowing, and some firms are laying off people, so others say we should do it as well.”Firms’ appetite for the best talent, which has materialized in the form of increasingly large incoming classes in recent years, further complicates the problem.“Especially at a larger firm, every year they have a substantial number of people coming in that they more or less committed to them two years prior,” Sterling said. “Firms may be continuously thinking about their numbers and people coming in in the fall, and feel—and should feel—there is a commitment that has been made to give these people a chance to be successful at the firm. That could explain the gap between when we think there should be layoffs and when they occur.”"
"Dear Laid-off Candidates,Do not come on here to Thank Companies for laying you off. it is cringe and very ridiculous. It is like thanking someone for shooting you in the foot because the person gave you an ""opportunity"".You are also sending the wrong message to employers that when they carry our layoffs, they will get ""thank you messages "". Layoffs can have profound impacts on individuals' lives, causing financial instability, emotional distress, and uncertainty about the future. Expressing gratitude towards employers in such circumstances may imply a level of acceptance and contentment with the situation, which could undermine efforts to seek better opportunities or hold employers accountable for their actions."
"Hi Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, do you think it is possible for LinkedIn to consider providing complimentary LinkedIn Premium Account for 2-3 months, for people who lost their jobs due to layoffs? Perhaps what people can do is to provide their separation papers if they are willing to do son or if they have made a post on LinkedIn announcing that they have unfortunately been laid-off, and LinkedIn assess in a way that can be automated to a certain extent and provide a complimentary Premium Account for a couple of months so that they can maximise their job search impact on the platform? Of course, this could be subjected to abuse, if there are users who fakes papers or lies. I think the crux is - there can be ways to reduce (not avoid completely) the abuse. Make it once off, operates from a purpose perspective, after all, one of LinkedIn's institutional purpose is to improve the economic social graph isn't it? Thank you for considering."
"I hate hearing this phrase:👇 👇 👇 ""Find a good job and you'll never have to look again.""🙄 *Cue Stanley face* (The Office)At one point, maybe this was good advice. Like back when people still had landlines. We're not living in a golden economy anymore.Even the generation that touts this nonsense advice doesn't abide by it.In 2017 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that younger baby boomers held an average of 12 jobs between 18-52. What gives!?Why are we still setting younger professionals up to fail by giving them this advice?7 reasons from the last 2.5 decades why you MUST diversify:1st - Late 90s: Companies notoriously fired tenured employees just before retirement, an act seen as cruel and dishonest.2nd - 2000-2002: The dot-com bubble burst, sending shockwaves through the tech industry.3rd - Early 00s: Outsourcing hits manufacturing jobs, particularly in furniture factories, is seen as a betrayal to American workers.4th - 2003-2004: I'm in college surrounded by laid-off workers in the 50s & 60s desperately seeking to update their skills. Many struggle with learning basic computer tasks.5th - 2008-2009: The Housing Crisis wreaks havoc on the economy.6th - 2010-13: Rise of killer apps disrupts entire industries.7th - 2022-2023: A wave of layoffs hit the tech industry.What will the 8th one be? And more importantly, will you be diversified & connected enough to weather the storm?Moving across multiple companies is VERY good for the career architect:💪 Diversified skillset (even if same role/industry, it's a new SOP)💪 Higher than average salary (each pivot point is a chance to level set)💪 Removes glass ceiling (bigger impact, title bump- IF you choose wisely)💪 Make that network thicc baby (they really do save lives)💪 Adaptability (Each new company gives you a new language to speak)💪 Find YOUR right fit (Like an artist building up a sculpture, each stint adds a layer to your masterpiece)I find that it's much easier to intentionally introduce disruption to myself, under my own terms, than have to dance to the tune fate has laid down for me.Power to the people.Follow me for regular reminders like this one; click name, then Follow, then the bell.I'm Seth Killian 📐💲 and I write every weekday about career advice, productivity, how to look out for yourself, and I generally like to be a little sacrilegious.💩👇 I want my like."

"Grab confirms layoffs in PH businessGrab Philippines said it remained committed to fulfilling its goal of providing 500,000 job opportunities here despite its parent company’s restructuring activity resulting in 1,000 employees across Southeast Asia being laid off.The company confirmed the layoffs covered the Philippine business, but it declined to give a number.In a statement on Monday, the super app operator dominating the local ride-hailing market said the Philippines “has always been an important market for Grab.”“We remain steadfast in our promise to create 500,000 livelihood opportunities in the Philippines and will continue to make progress on this by creating meaningful opportunities for everyday Filipinos and small businesses to earn a livelihood on our platform, whether as a driver-partner, delivery partner, merchant partner,” Grab Philippines country head Grace Vera-Cruz said.Read more https://lnkd.in/eZbtE328[ Cr by Grab  Philippines ]#VRITIMESPH #media #pr #pressrelease #marketing #philippines #phtoday"

"🌟 Navigating Layoffs: Embracing Resilience in Tough Times 🚀Let's be real: being laid off sucks. It's a gut-wrenching experience that can leave us feeling lost and uncertain about our future. But even in moments when we feel depleted, we can find the inner resilience to push throughand accomplish great things.Layoffs are not a reflection of our worth or abilities. They are often the result of external circumstances beyond our control. It's okay to feel hurt, angry, or disappointed. Give yourself permission to process those emotions.Remember, you're not alone. Countless professionals have gone through similar challenges and come out stronger on the other side. Reach out to your support network, friends, and mentors who can provide guidance and lend an empathetic ear.While it may not feel like it now, this setback can be a catalyst for personal and professional growth. Take this time to reflect on your skills, passions, and goals. Use it as an opportunity to explore new avenues, upgrade your skills, or even consider pursuing entrepreneurial ventures.Stay resilient. Job opportunities may not come knocking immediately, but with perseverance, networking, and continuous learning, you can carve a new path. Surround yourself with positive influences, attend virtual events, and connect with others in your industry. Build relationships that can lead to future opportunities.Lastly, be kind to yourself throughout this process. Treat yourself with compassion and celebrate small wins along the way. You've got this, and brighter days are ahead.Together, let's embrace resilience, support one another, and navigate the challenges of layoffs with strength and determination! 💪🌈💼🌟#Layoffs #Resilience #PersonalGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment #SupportNetwork"

"More than 374,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2022 and 2023 including many immigrants. Few people know these 6 devastating things that happen to workers on a U.S. visa:1/ Workers on visas only have 60 days from the moment they are laid to find a new job. If they don't find a new job, they need to leave the country or change status.2/ Workers on visa like H-1Bs and L-1s often have spouses who work using a dependent visa like the H-4 or L-2. When the principal immigrant is laid off, the dependent spouse loses their right to work after a grace period.3/ Layoffs potentially end an immigrant worker's green card process. The employee-sponsored green card process has many steps including PERM, certifying PERM, filing I-140, getting I-140 approval, filing I-485, & finally getting the green card. Being laid off at any stage in this process can have serious impacts to an immigrants timeline for green card & citizenship.4/ Workers on L-1 visas can not transfer their visas to another company, so they are required to find a similar role at the company that just laid them off... 😐 If that doesn't work, they have to leave the U.S.5/ Laid off workers who return to their home country and sell their U.S. assets are still required to pay state and federal taxes. They may also have other U.S. financial obligations that they'll need to resolve from their home country.6/ Workers on visas are not able to use all social services like SNAP, CHIP, SSI, TANF, wellfare, state child care, medicaid, etc even if they have been paying into these benefits for years.Here's why I share this post:(1) to inform anyone in my network of this reality so they can have empathy and (2) to ask hiring managers and HR leaders who are hiring to consider hiring more immigrants, and (3) to encourage companies to consider the immigration consequences of their HR decisions and have a more people-driven approach."
"For those who are still getting on their feet after #layoffs, here is my #jobsearching timeline from laid off (4 May 2023) to hired (7 June 2023) in case helpful:- W1 (over the weekend): Process emotions, share job searching on LinkedIn, ask myself what I'd like to do next, look at job listings on various portals and make a shortlist 😢- W2: Continue posting on LinkedIn, talking to recruiters/friends who reached out, start applying via job listing forms and referrals, do a few 1st recruiter screens, study, study, study for technical interviews (this week was hectic because my wife was working and I was looking after our kid alone) 💪- W3: do all remaining recruiter screens, do round 1 & some round 2 technical interviews, juggle interview scheduling to keep all processes roughly aligned 🔥- W4: finish up all round 2 technical interviews, receive first offer 💰- W5: receive all remaining offers, #negotiate compensation among 3 companies I wanted to join 💵- W6: think real hard about which offer to accept and accept! 🎉There's a lot that this timeline doesn't say, like how stressful it was to suddenly lose a job with a 1.5 year old, as the main person working in the family, and with our stay in Germany conditional on successfully finding a new job within 3 months. But the fact that I've gotten a new job (with several offers) in this economic climate in ~1 month after a layoff shouldn't be ignored. I'm no superstar engineer. I don't speak at conferences. I'm still just 7 years into my career.It is stressful, it is hard work, but bouncing back with a new job is possible, even highly probable.If you are one of those who was affected by #layoffs, take it from me: I know you'll get through it. And remember: getting hired by another employer is just one way through."
"On Friday I was laid off from my job where I did culture & equity work for a non-profit foundation. In my layoff meeting I was told culture work would be taken on by the Talent department. this article covers the many reasons why HR should not hold DEI work.as companies think through how they plan to engage in DEI efforts, especially as the work is being threatened in this sociopolitical climate, I urge employees/individuals to look at orgs who have DEI positions or work in their HR departments with immense skepticism. HR departments protect company policies and practices not people. this snippet of the article is one of the many gems, check out the rest in the shared link below! “ While HR does comprise a DEI component, it cannot accommodate the sum of all its parts and the desired change cannot be accomplished from a siloed department. The goals and approaches of DEI too often conflict with those of HR. For example, DEI is about transparency, but HR departments are designed to err on the side of protecting the company, its brand, and its central interest—profit—against potential litigious backlash.”"

"I did something very uncomfortable.After being laid off from my job - a rollercoaster of emotions has started.I felt helpless. Useless. Anxious. Depressed. My self-esteem became non-existent, and the sh!tty recruitment experiences I had while interviewing for other roles didn't help my mental health.[Spoiler: I'm still looking for a job in TA 😅]So, after spending several months feeling horrible while also doing therapy, I decided to do something and get out of my comfort zone.I learned how to do tattoos! 🖤I worked with a tattoo artist that I love and learned from her. I thought that maybe this could become another job, or maybe just a hobby. I don't know yet. I'm still a beginner, I'm really bad at it... but I made it. 💪🏼I committed to the course and I had a lot of fun. And this is the most important thing because having a goal and positive feelings is what I needed the most now... even more than a new job. 🤗Almost everyone will tell you to use the time you have while being unemployed to do something and reskill for a new job: honestly, I don't agree.I'm saying use this time in whatever way you want as long as it's not hurting anybody. 💖 [obviously, not applicable to everyone, I understand that if you have some personal reasons you may not have this flexibility]I chose, for now, to use it like this, doing something incredibly uncomfortable that I thought I'd never be able to do... and I made my first tattoo on myself! 😃I have several tattoos on my body but doing it on myself was a very different feeling: I couldn't feel the pain when the needle was into my skin, because the focus was on making sure the design looked good rather than how I was feeling. It was an awesome learning experience that made me grow a lot. 🌱So, while I keep looking for a new role I'm going to see what other skills to pick up... who knows, maybe I'll learn how to play the harp... or how to bake amazing vegan cakes... or how to make fabulous hairstyles for cats... you name it! 🌸But one thing is for sure: during my ups and downs, applying to jobs and giving out about bad recruitment practices (😅), I will do my best to have fun. 🥰[Picture of me ""stabbing"" myself with a tattoo machine while feeling zero pain 💪🏼]#experience #learning #recruitment #art #layoff"
"Social app IRL shuts down as investigation reveals majority of reported users were bots IRL, the social app that aimed to bring people together for real-life events, has ironically been revealed to have a majority of non-existent users. An internal investigation conducted by IRL’s board of directors discovered that 95% of the reported 20 million users on the app were either automated or bots, according to The Information. Consequently, despite raising over $200 million in venture capital, IRL is now shutting down.🚀 Initially positioned as an alternative for event organizing among Generation Z, who are decreasing their usage of Facebook, IRL faced internal challenges after securing a $170 million Series C funding round led by SoftBank, which valued the company at $1.17 billion.💔 Last year, IRL laid off approximately 25% of its team, amounting to around 25 employees. These layoffs came as a surprise, considering that IRL had significantly increased its headcount in the previous year. Former CEO and founder Abraham Shafi, in a memo to employees obtained by TechCrunch, urged them to adapt and be disciplined, citing WhatsApp’s achievement of amassing 450 million users with a team of just 55.❓ While Shafi claimed in the memo that the company had sufficient funds to last until 2024, doubts arose among IRL employees regarding the accuracy of the app’s reported 20 million monthly active users. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated an investigation into whether IRL violated securities laws. Consequently, IRL’s board of directors suspended Shafi and appointed an acting CEO in April.📢 Attempts to reach out to Shafi and another IRL employee were unsuccessful, as both their IRL email addresses have been disabled. The current financial status of IRL remains uncertain, but the company has stated that it will return its remaining capital to shareholders, according to The Information."
"Some people I care about are waiting to hear if they'll be laid off and I know they aren't sleeping well.  I talk to people every week who are making career searches months after a #layoff.  There's no denying that a layoff is a blow to your ego and shakes up your sense of security. It just does.So let's look at the 𝟑 𝐏'𝐬 𝐨𝐟 #𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞...𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 - This phase in your working life has run its course.  Your leaders made choices.  The environment shifted.  It's time for one door to close so another door can open.  Think of something that was an upset many years ago that you now count as a blessing because it brought you to something better.  This is one of those inflection points. Think of this as a springboard moment. This too shall pass.𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 - Your life is so much more than work. This disappointing moment in your career need not color your life with family and friends (and aren't these your most important relationships anyway?).  Put some boundaries on this hurt knowing it's temporary and enjoy the joy in all the other places in your life.  Take a walk and get some sunshine on your face. Do whatever makes you smile.𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 - A layoff is an event beyond your control, not a statement about you.  Again, leaders made choices to maintain a number on a spreadsheet.  Business processes often say ""it's just business"" because it's less convenient to acknowledge and take responsibility for the real impact to real people.  You should detach too and put all your energy into what serves you. Take a moment to remember how far you've come over the years.  Pat yourself on the back for the accomplishments you're proud of.  You'll make more of these moments.If you are ready to take action and move forward, I hope you'll DM me to start a conversation to uncover your success stories, refine your search process, and create regular check ins to stay on track in your search.  #resume #jobsearch-Posted by OneUp"
