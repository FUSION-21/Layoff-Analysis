"My friends and colleagues would tell you that being impacted by the recent Meta #layoffs has been mentally rough for me, but here's to trying to move forward with grace - I think it's important to recognize that in the society we live in, employment is a privilege, not a right - though certainly it should be both. That we are ultimately viewed as a statistic in the face of critical business decisions is an inevitable corporate reality, especially in big tech companies. While undoubtedly frustrating, such decisions are ultimately impersonal, and it is not lost on me that to have had Meta as my first job, and to have found employment outside Manila, has been in itself a massive privilege.There is a very long list of things to be grateful for. On top of that list, as my manager would say, is the people. The one truth that has remained constant throughout each chapter of my life is that my community makes me, and I am immensely grateful for the people I've worked with, grown with, and learned from both professionally and personally. The job might not always last, but the people and the impact they make on us are there to stay forever. So this is a massive thank you to my manager, my team, my cross-functionals, and my friends, who have collectively made my experience at Meta as meaningful as it was, no matter how short.I'm excited to embark on the next chapter of my career, and I would appreciate any support from my network, particularly through the following:üëâüèº Leads, recommendations, or referrals for jobs you think I might be suited for (i.e. project management, risk management, vendor management, ops roles in tech)¬†üëâüèº Profile recommendations and skill endorsements from the people I've worked withüëâüèº Reactions and comments on my post for extended reachPlease feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn or email at ng.jerome.c@gmail.com for any recommendations, opportunities, or even a chat over coffee if you're going through something similar! Thanks so much for your support! üí™üèº"
"I saw it coming.The signs were there and team members were getting deactivated. This wasn't like my first layoff. That one was filled with emotion, confusion, and shame.This one I understood. Nobody wants to lay off their team, especially at small startups. But business is business, and my time had come.I spent my last few minutes making up a custom background. I waited until the point in the call when it was official (because imagine how awkward that would be if I wasn't being laid off...), and then I uploaded this ""in memoriam"" background. It was well received ( üôè ) and I was able to use my last few moments how I wanted: to say what I needed to say, to express my gratitude for 4 years of learning and development. To be truly present in the call and have a meaningful final sign-off.I don't think this will be my last layoff. ""In this economy"" it feels inevitable. But I know that my accomplishments and worth aren't tied to this decision. I can be proud of the professional growth I accomplished and be grateful for the team that took the journey with me.Now I just need to find the next team that will appreciate my sense of humor as much as this one did. ü•Å ---If you know of anyone hiring for a marketing manager, my areas of focus include content, lifecycle, community, and brand! I've managed teams of 10+ and care deeply about the human experience, whether you're a customer or a teammate. Cheers for any references!#marketingmanager #layoffs #openforwork"
"I got a job. After 40 interviews and what has to be hundreds and hundreds of applications, it finally worked out.Here are 9 things I learned during my job search after my layoff:1. Ensure your resume is compatible w/ applicant tracking systems. I had no idea this was a thing until I worked specifically with a resume writer, but given the sheer volume of applicants, having a resume that is automatically parsable by internal systems makes a difference.2. Daily goals. Setting daily goals helped me maintain a balance and create a routine as I was applying. For me personally, these included applying to at least 5 jobs daily, not turning on the TV until after 5pm, and spending at least an hour a day reading or learning something new. This helped create structure during an unpredictable period.3. Apply daily and filter on the last 24 hrs. Given the market, some jobs I applied for had 300+ applicants. To combat this, on a day to day basis, filter your search to jobs posted in the last 24 hrs. By doing so, I was usually within the first few to apply for a job, which helped get my foot in the door. Baking this into your daily routine makes it a lot less overwhelming to apply for positions, as there are fewer postings you need to scroll through every day.4. Nationwide vs city filters for remote jobs. If you are open to remote work, have separate alerts for your overall country as well as your individual city. A lot of remote jobs don‚Äôt show up in city specific listings.5. Flexible title searching. Position titles change across companies, so don‚Äôt just limit it to a single title search. Have a job search going for the specific title you are aiming for, but also have an alert that filters a more generic title e.g. ‚ÄúProduct Manager‚Äù, with additional filtering on experience level. 6. Responses come in waves. There will be weeks where you won't hear anything, and a week will come up where you hear from multiple places all at once. Remain patient, and know that responses and interview requests will come in batches.7. Compensation. Ask for the compensation range during your first call. Interview processes are extremely lengthy and time consuming, make sure that at the end of the line if you were to receive an offer, it would match your expectations.8. Culture & fit. While we‚Äôre the ones applying for a job, its important to make sure that the company is a good fit for us as well. We spend so much of our time at work, so it's important to ask and assess things such as work culture, team dynamic, and manager personality and philosophy.9. Take time to relax. This is the most important. It's ok to do nothing for a bit. It's ok to take time out of your day and do something that brings you joy. It's ok to not have everything you do on a day to day basis be related to finding a job or bettering yourself.¬†Extended time away from work, no matter the circumstances, doesn't come around often - use it well.#jobsearch #layoffs #jobhunt #hiring #jobhelp"
"Happy Monday Morning, network! It's taken me a while to make a post, but back in March I was one of the masses that was affected by Meta's layoffs. Getting that email - my heart sunk. I dodged the first rounds of layoffs, and was so hopeful I would get to keep my dream job. But when that morning did come, that email stung more than I expected it to.The past few months have been harder than I anticipated. Part of me believed that working at Meta and having a stellar track record would help me glide into my next role, but it wasn't long before I realized that I was up against many of my extremely talented colleagues and friends in every interview I went into.It's a challenge to make yourself stick out or when so many of us in the same industry are reaching for help. Heck, I even feel bold enough to tag my former manager James Hudson to testify to my abilities! (Side note, if you ever get managed by James, you might be one of the luckiest people out there)So here I am, y'all! Taking courses to better my recruiting skills for when that next dream job comes my way, and reaching out to all of you for leads and help along the way.If you know of anyone that's looking for a Talent Partner that's an ambitious and enthusiastic collaborator, or can help you achieve a well rounded workforce; here I am! I'm always ready for a challenge, a phone call, or a lead.Cheers to this wild road, and everyone that helps lead me down it!#layoffs #jobseeker #recruiting #talent #diversity #ihopethisworks"

"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain ‚Äì this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return.

I also want to thank Jennifer Baumgartner for being a supportive and highly motivating manager.  To my network, please let me know if you hear of any companies in need of a seasoned (and incredibly patient) Deal Desk leader! ü§òüèª#route #layoffs #dealdesk #revops"

"Hey folks, I have some unfortunate news to share.After 5 years at New Relic, I've been impacted by a global layoff that occurred today. That said, there are a bunch of us looking for new roles. Please let me know what you have available in the Sales, Customer Success, Solution Consulting/Engineering, or Product Management areas.New Relic has provided me with amazing career growth and I am very grateful for all of the wonderful people that I've worked with and supported over the years.#OpenToWork#NewRelic#Layoffs"
"Life after the layoff: DAY 52What was your shortest job tenure?For me, it was job number six.With the telemarketing chapter of my life complete, I was enjoying the life of a job-free high school senior. That was until my science teacher, Mr. Voigts, recommended me to Harlan, the owner of the local grain elevator at the north end of town. I went there and got the details from Harlan: work from after school until supper during the week, plus Saturdays. The wage was $7.25/hour, more than I earned in most other jobs before and after that for a while. I agreed, and started the next day.Farmers sell their corn and soybeans at a grain elevator at harvest time. You may have seen an elevator in a small town, with their shiny steel bins. Tractors pull up to them with their wagons and unload the grain ‚Äì this was where I helped out most of the time. The remaining time was just for odd jobs around the place, doing things that OSHA would probably frown upon, especially for a 17 year-old. Lots of finger-hungry machines and copious amounts of grain dust. The most harrowing thing was being asked to climb the metal ladder up the 70-foot-tall elevator leg to grease it. Still makes my palms sweat.The money was coming in and burning a hole in my pocket. I remember heading to Co-Op Records in the college town 45 minutes away to spend part of my first paycheck on a Pearl Jam live bootleg CD that cost $29.99. I was making bootleg-CD-level wages. Sweet!Harlan requested that I get the tractor from the shed and pull it around to hook up to another piece of equipment. This tractor had a loader on the front, making it stick out much more than I was used to. When I backed out, I turned too soon and peeled back about 18"" of trim from the shed door. A silly mistake, but nothing that a hammer and three nails couldn't remedy.I received a somewhat stern warning to avoid hitting anything else on the property with the loader, especially the expensive blowers attached to the steel bins. I went about the rest of the shift feeling sheepish, but not concerned. At shift's end, I went inside to ask if I was needed the next day. This was normal, as it was always going to be a short-term gig during the peak of the harvest season. Every day so far, I was asked to return. Not this day.""Do you need me to come in tomorrow, Harlan?"" I asked.""Nope, I think we're good,"" he said.""How about the rest of the week?"" I inquired, pretty much already knowing the answer.""Nope.""There you have it. Not dismissed, but not asked to return the next day, either. Those two and a half weeks of labor would be my last in the agricultural realm. I wasn't ready for content work yet, but I was one step closer.‚ù¶ Let me know if you are looking for a UX/Content Design Leader, as I'm #opentowork! #layoffs #uxwriter #contentdesign #productdesign #UXdesign #contentstrategy ‚ù¶"
"I feel sympathy for the 22,500 employees of Credit Suisse who are about to lose their jobs https://lnkd.in/gS575ai9.  Some of them have no doubt lost a significant portion of their savings also, due to 401k plan investments, deferred compensation, etc.  At one time, Credit Suisse was a world-class firm, highly regarded by competitors and customers alike.  And in different ways, this will be a painful, awful experience for all CS former employees living through this transition, just as it was for the thousands of people (myself included) who lost their jobs when Bear Stearns hit the wall in 2008.  Nobody likes losing their job, but when a firm collapses in ignominious fashion, it is especially difficult.  As with the Bear collapse and the Lehman bankruptcy, reputations have been damaged.  But you are not your firm, and you are not your firm's incompetent management (unless you are, in fact, the management, in which case you should be ashamed of yourselves).   Wall Street is great at creative destruction, so if you work hard, remain modest, and focus on your customers, you will be able to rebuild your career.   #creditsuisse #ubs #layoffs #wallstreet #transitions"

"Hey all, guess it's my turn to post..You probably haven't seen a post from me in a long time (if ever), I mostly use LinkedIn as a tool to learn from my networks and other professionals in my space.Unfortunately, after over 3 years at Route, the entire enablement department has been cut.I wanted to take a few days to reflect on my time at Route before posting. Route was a company where I was constantly challenged and was constantly learning. It's somewhere I made lifelong friends and grew tremendously, both professionally and personally. I was caught off guard and disappointed by this news, but over all, I am very thankful for my time at Route.I also want to take a moment to thank Jessika Ward and David Rogers for being two of the best leaders I've ever worked with. I've learned so much from you both and will miss working together. It's a small world and I'm sure we'll cross paths again.With that being said, I am now open for work! While I started out my career as an AE, I've leveraged that expertise into a Sales Enablement and Operations focus. I have in-depth experience creating and managing onboarding programs, creating long term training programs, change management, sales processes, etc.I'm open to roles in Revenue Enablement and Operations, and hope you'll all keep me in mind for any new opportunities that come up.Thank you all for your support and thank you to all my friends at Route, it's time to find my next adventure!#layoffs #salesenablement #salesoperations #techlayoffs #layoffs2023"
